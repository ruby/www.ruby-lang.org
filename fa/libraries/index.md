Nearly all of these libraries are released in the form of a **gem**,
a packaged library or application that can be installed with a tool
called [**RubyGems**][1].

RubyGems is a Ruby packaging system designed to facilitate the creation,
sharing and installation of libraries (in some ways, it is a distribution
packaging system similar to, say, `apt-get`, but targeted at Ruby software).
Ruby comes with RubyGems by default since version 1.9, previous
Ruby versions require RubyGems to be [installed by hand][2].

Some other libraries are released as archived (.zip or .tar.gz)
directories of **source code**. Installation processes may vary,
typically a `README` or `INSTALL` file is available with instructions.

Let’s take a look at finding libraries and installing them for your own
use.

### Finding libraries

The main place where libraries are hosted is [**RubyGems.org**][1], a public
repository of gems that can be searched and installed onto your machine.
You may browse and search for gems using the RubyGems website,
or use the `gem` command.

Using `gem search -r`, you can search RubyGems' repository. For
instance, `gem search -r rails` will return a list of Rails-related
gems. With the `--local` (`-l`) option, you would perform a local search
through your installed gems. To install a gem, use `gem install [gem]`.
Browsing installed gems is done with `gem list`. For more
information about the `gem` command, see below or head to
[RubyGems’ docs][3].

There are other sources of libraries though.
[**GitHub**][5] is the main Ruby-related content repository.
Most often a gem source code will be hosted on GitHub while being
published as a fully-fledged gem to RubyGems.org.

[**The Ruby Toolbox**][6] is a project that makes it easy to explore open
source Ruby projects. It has categories for various common development tasks,
collects a lot of information about the projects like release and commit
activity or dependencies and rates projects based on their popularity on
RubyGems.org and GitHub. This makes it easy to find a gem which solves
a particular problem such as web frameworks, documentation tools and
code quality libraries.

### A few more words about RubyGems

Here is a quick review of the `gem` command for your daily use.
[More detailed documentation][7] is available, covering all aspects
of this packaging system.

#### Searching among available gems

The **search** command can be used to look for gems, based on a string.
Gems which names start with the specified string will be listed in return.
For instance, to search for the “html”-related gems:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem search -r html

*** REMOTE GEMS ***

html-sample (1.0, 1.1)
{% endhighlight %}

The `--remote` / `-r` flag indicates that we want to inspect the
official RubyGems.org repository (default behaviour).
With the `--local` / `-l` flag you would perform a local search
among your installed gems.

#### Installing a gem

Once you know which gem you would like to **install**, for instance the
popular Ruby on Rails framework:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem install rails
{% endhighlight %}

You can even install just a specific version of the library, using the
`--version` / `-v` flag:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem install rails --version 5.0
{% endhighlight %}

#### Listing all gems

For a **list** of all locally installed gems:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem list
{% endhighlight %}

To obtain a (very long) list of all gems available on RubyGems.org:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem list -r
{% endhighlight %}

#### Help!

Documentation is available inside your terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem help
{% endhighlight %}

For instance, `gem help commands` is very useful as it outputs a list of
all `gem`’s commands.

#### Crafting your own gems

RubyGems.org has [several guides][3] about this topic. You may also want
to investigate [Bundler][9], a generic tool which helps you manage an
application’s dependencies and may be used along RubyGems.
