Ruby blogs have exploded over the past year and, given sufficient
hunting, you can unearth hundreds of blogs sharing bits of Ruby code,
describing new techniques, or speculating on Ruby’s future.

### Mining for Ruby Blogs

[**Ruby on del.icio.us**][1]\: Ruby and Rails are consistently one of
the top fifty tags on del.icio.us, a popular link sharing site. Watch
the [ruby][1] tag for incoming obscure links and its [popularity
chart][2] for recent upcomers in the Ruby community.

**Planets**\: some planets (online specialized feeds agregators) have been running for years now. A few of them providing convenient content:

* [Ruby Corner][4]
* [Planet Ruby][5]
* [PlanetRubyOnRails.org][6]
* [PlanetRubyOnRails.com][7]

### Blogs of Note

A few notable blogs stand out for the frequency and immediacy of their
updates.

* [**O’Reilly Ruby**][8] is a group blog with pertinent Ruby tutorials
  and interviews with interesting folks from around the community.
* [**Riding Rails**][9] is the official group blog of the Ruby on Rails
  team. If you are running Rails, this blog is essential for
  notification of security updates and an overall view of the wide Rails
  community.
* [**Ruby Inside**][10] announces interesting applications and libraries
  from throughout the world, both Ruby and Rails.
* [**Matz’ Blog**][11] is a Japanese blog written by Ruby’s creator.
  Even if you can’t read all of it, it’s good to know he’s right there!
* [**Rails Envy**][12] is a blog and podcast where you can learn a lot
  about what’s going on in Rails and just plain Ruby. They have a good
  video collection too, where you can fast-forward through popular Ruby
  events or just be entertained.
* [**Ruby Web Developer news group**][13] is a new type of collaborative
  news site / feed reader where Rubyists discover, filter and comment on
  news that’s relevant to their profession.

### Spreading the Word

If you’ve got a Ruby blog you’ve started, it’s wise to link the blog on
[del.icio.us][14] with the *ruby* tag. You might also contact the
weblogs above, if you are covering a topic they’d be interested in.
(Obviously, if it’s not Rails-related, then the *Riding Rails* crew may
not be as interested—but you never know.)

Ruby is also a common topic on both [Digg][15] and [Slashdot][16], in
their respective programming news. If you find some brilliant code out
there, be sure to let them know!
