## Iterators

### What is an iterator?

An iterator is a method which accepts a block or a `Proc` object. In the
source file, the block is placed immediately after the invocation of the
method. Iterators are used to produce user-defined control
structures---especially loops.

Let's look at an example to see how this works. Iterators are often used to
repeat the same action on each element of a collection, like this:

~~~
data = [1, 2, 3]
data.each do |i|
  puts i
end
~~~

Produces:

~~~
1
2
3
~~~

The each method of the array `data` is passed the `do ... end` block,
and executes it repeatedly. On each call, the block is passed successive
elements of the array.

You can define blocks with `{ ... }` in place of `do ... end`.

~~~
data = [1, 2, 3]
data.each { |i|
  puts i
}
~~~

Produces:

~~~
1
2
3
~~~

This code has the same meaning as the last example. However, in some cases,
precedence issues cause `do ... end` and `{ ... }` to act differently.

~~~
foobar a, b do ... end  # foobar is the iterator.
foobar a, b { ... }     # b is the iterator.
~~~

This is because `{ ... }` binds more tightly to the preceding expression
than does a `do ... end` block. The first example is equivalent to
`foobar(a, b) do ... end`, while the second is `foobar(a, b { ... })`.

### How can I pass a block to an iterator?

You simply place the block after the iterator call. You can also pass a
`Proc` object by prepending `&` to the variable or constant name that refers
to the `Proc`.

### How is a block used in an iterator?

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

There are three ways to execute a block from an iterator method:
(1) the `yield` control structure; (2) calling a `Proc` argument
(made from a block) with `call`; and (3) using `Proc.new` followed by a call.

The `yield` statement calls the block, optionally passing it one or more
arguments.

~~~
def my_iterator
  yield 1, 2
end

my_iterator {|a, b| puts a, b }
~~~

Produces:

~~~
1
2
~~~

If a method definition has a block argument (the last formal parameter has
an ampersand (`&`) prepended), it will receive the attached block, converted
to a `Proc` object. This may be called using `prc.call(args)`.

~~~
def my_iterator(&b)
  b.call(1, 2)
end

my_iterator {|a, b| puts a, b }
~~~

Produces:

~~~
1
2
~~~

`Proc.new` (or the equivalent `proc` or `lambda` calls), when used in an
iterator definition, takes the block which is given to the method as its
argument and generates a procedure object from it.
(`proc` and `lambda` are effectively synonyms.)

_[Update needed: `lambda` behaves in a slightly different way and
produces a warning `tried to create Proc object without a block`.]_

~~~
def my_iterator
  Proc.new.call(3, 4)
  proc.call(5, 6)
  lambda.call(7, 8)
end

my_iterator {|a, b| puts a, b }
~~~

Produces:

~~~
3
4
5
6
7
8
~~~

Perhaps surprisingly, `Proc.new` and friends do not in any sense consume
the block attached to the method---each call to `Proc.new` generates a new
procedure object out of the same block.

You can tell if there is a block associated with a method by calling
`block_given?`.

### What does `Proc.new` without a block do?

`Proc.new` without a block cannot generate a procedure object and an error
occurs. In a method definition, however, `Proc.new` without a block implies
the existence of a block at the time the method is called, and so no error
will occur.

### How can I run iterators in parallel?

Here an adoption of a solution by Matz, in
[\[ruby-talk:5252\]][ruby-talk:5252], that uses threads:

~~~
require "thread"

def combine(*iterators)
  queues = []
  threads = []

  iterators.each do |it|
    queue = SizedQueue.new(1)
    th = Thread.new(it, queue) do |i, q|
           send(i) {|x| q << x }
         end
    queues  << queue
    threads << th
  end

  loop do
    ary = []
    queues.each {|q| ary << q.pop }
    yield ary

    iterators.size.times do |i|
      return if !threads[i].status && queues[i].empty?
    end
  end
end

def it1
  yield 1; yield 2; yield 3
end

def it2
  yield 4; yield 5; yield 6
end

combine(:it1, :it2) do |x|
  # x is [1, 4], then [2, 5], then [3, 6]
end
~~~
