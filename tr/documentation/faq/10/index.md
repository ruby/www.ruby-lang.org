## Extension library

### How can I use Ruby interactively?
{: #irb}

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

You can try using `irb`. The following is paraphrased from Kentaro Goto
(Gotoken), and originally appeared in [\[ruby-talk:444\]][ruby-talk:444].

1. Get the latest tarball of `irb` from the
   [contrib directory](ftp://ftp.netlab.co.jp/pub/lang/ruby/contrib/)
   in the Ruby archive.
2. Extract the `irb` directory tree.
3. Add the location of the `irb/` directory to the `$RUBYLIB`
   environment variable.
4. Make a symbolic link from `$RUBYLIB/irb/irb.rb` to a file called `irb`
   somewhere in your path.
5. `chmod +x $RUBYLIB/irb/irb.rb`
6. Possibly use `rehash` to tell your login shell about the new command.
7. Type `irb`.

If the readline extension module works with your interpreter, it makes `irb`
a lot more fun to use.

There is also a simple program, `eval`, in the `samples/` directory of the
Ruby distribution. It lets you enter expressions and view their values.
You can copy `eval` into the `site_ruby` directory in the Ruby tree, and
then invoke it using:

~~~
ruby -r eval -e0
~~~

### Is there a debugger for Ruby?

There is a gdb-like debugger for Ruby.

~~~
ruby -r debug your_program
~~~

### How can I use a library written in C from Ruby?

Of all the scripting languages, Ruby is probably the easiest to extend.
There are no problems with reference counting and variable types, and very
few interfaces to learn. In fact, C code used to extend Ruby often ends up
looking surprisingly like Ruby code itself.

First, read the `doc/extension.rdoc` file in the Ruby source,
or read [extension.rdoc on docs.ruby-lang.org][extension-rdoc].
This is a good document, not only if you are writing an extension library,
but also if you want to understand Ruby more deeply.

Then, the RubyGems site provides a
[guide on creating gems with extensions][rubygems-guide].
It shows how to setup a gem with C extensions that are built at install time.
It has also links to some existing gems that wrap C libraries and
to further reading.

You might also want to have a look at the source of the interpreter itself,
and at the various supplied extensions in the `ext/` directory
(you can browse the [Ruby repository on GiHub][ruby-github]).

### Can I use Tcl/Tk in Ruby?

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

There are two interfaces to Tcl/Tk included in the standard distribution.
One is under `ext/tcltk/` and loaded with `require "tcltk"`. The syntax is
very close to that Tcl which is passed on to the Tcl interpreter.
Unfortunately, the description for this library is written in Japanese.

The other is under `ext/tk/` and loaded with `require "tk"`. Its syntax
is closer to the style of the Tk interface provided by the Perl and Python
interfaces.

### Tk won't work. Why?

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

Your Tk version may be old, try a newer version.

### Can I use gtk+ or xforms interfaces in Ruby?

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

You will find `ruby-gtk-x.xx.tar.gz` and `ruby-forms-x.x.tar.gz`
under `contrib/` on the Ruby ftp sites.

### How can I do date arithmetic?

{% include faq-out-of-date.html %}

A `Time` object can express only the dates between Jan 1, 1970 and
Jan 19, 2038.

Two standard extension library modules are provided:
`require "date"`, which is simple and uses the English calendar,
and `require "date2"`, which is more general purpose.

Also see `sample/cal.rb`.
