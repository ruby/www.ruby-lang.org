A buffer overrun vulnerability was discovered in CGI.escape_html.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2021-41816](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41816).
We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

## Details

A security vulnerability that causes buffer overflow when you pass a very large string (> 700 MB) to `CGI.escape_html` on a platform where `long` type takes 4 bytes, typically, Windows.

Please update the cgi gem to version 0.3.1, 0.2.1, and 0.1.1 or later. You can use `gem update cgi` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "cgi", ">= 0.3.1"` to your `Gemfile`.
Alternatively, please update Ruby to 2.7.5 or 3.0.3.

This issue has been introduced since Ruby 2.7, so the cgi version bundled with Ruby 2.6 is not vulnerable.

## Affected versions

* cgi gem 0.1.0 or prior (which are bundled versions with Ruby 2.7 series prior to Ruby 2.7.5)
* cgi gem 0.2.0 or prior (which are bundled versions with Ruby 3.0 series prior to Ruby 3.0.3)
* cgi gem 0.3.0 or prior
