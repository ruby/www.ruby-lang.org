RAA is upgraded.

Changes:

* URL was changed. RAA is at [http://raa.ruby-lang.org/][1] now. Former
  URL https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa.html is redirected to the new URL.
* Add new page “All” that lists all RAA entries by alphabetical order.
* Show number of projects in each major\_category or minor category in
  listing view. We have 753 projects now. Is your stomach full?
* Add AND/OR search option. RAA search is substring search, not a word
  search.
* Project’s “name” field is restricted to match
  /\\A\[a-z0-9\_-\]\{2,15}\\z/ .
  * RAA users can refer a project with a simple name like “druby”. They
    don’t have to remember the ID number or a long name like “druby –
    distributed ruby”.
  * Application owner must specify canonical name(s) of his/her
    project(s).

  This field is a freezed (static, const) field. For each existing
  entries, I prepared a canonical name created from former name, Project
  UNIX Name in sourceforge or filename of its download item. See
  [\[ruby-talk:58018\]][2] for your entry. Since I created canonical
  names automatically with a script<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>, some owners
  would think that it isn’t a suitable name for their project. So UNTIL
  THE END OF THIS <abbr title="2002">YEAR</abbr> owner can change
  this “name” field of his/her entry.
* Add new field “short description”. Owners can describe short(63 bytes
  or shorter) description here. At now, this field is filled with former
  “name” field. Feel free to change this field anytime.
* To add an application entry, you must type pass phrase twice. Don’t
  forget your pass phrase.
