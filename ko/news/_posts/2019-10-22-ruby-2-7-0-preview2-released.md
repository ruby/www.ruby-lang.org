We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 2.7.0-preview2.

A preview version is released to gather feedback for the final release planned to release on December. It introduces a number of new features and performance improvements, most notably:

* Compaction GC
* Pattern Matching
* REPL improvement
* Separation of positional and keyword arguments

## Compaction GC

This release introduces Compaction GC which can defragment a fragmented memory space.

Some multi-threaded Ruby programs may cause memory fragmentation, leading to high memory usage and degraded speed.

The `GC.compact` method is introduced for compacting the heap. This function compacts live objects in the heap so that fewer pages may be used, and the heap may be more CoW friendly. [[Feature #15626]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15626)

## Pattern Matching [Experimental]

Pattern matching, widely used feature in functional programming languages, is introduced as an experimental feature. [[Feature #14912]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14912)
It can traverse a given object and assign its value if it matches a pattern.

{% highlight ruby %}
case JSON.parse('{...}', symbolize_names: true)
in {name: "Alice", children: [{name: "Bob", age: age}]}
  p age
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

For more details, please see [Pattern matching - New feature in Ruby 2.7](https://speakerdeck.com/k_tsj/pattern-matching-new-feature-in-ruby-2-dot-7).

## REPL improvement

`irb`, bundled interactive environment (REPL; Read-Eval-Print-Loop), now supports multi-line editing. It's powered by `reline`, `readline`-compatible pure Ruby implementation.
It also provides rdoc integration. In `irb` you can display the reference for a given class, module, or method.  [[Feature #14683]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14683), [[Feature #14787]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14787), [[Feature #14918]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14918)
Besides, source lines shown at `binding.irb` and inspect results for core-class objects are now colorized.

## Separation of positional and keyword arguments

Automatic conversion of keyword arguments and positional arguments is
deprecated, and conversion will be removed in Ruby 3.  [[Feature #14183]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14183)

* When a method call passes a Hash at the last argument, and when it
  passes no keywords, and when the called method accepts keywords, a
  warning is emitted.  To continue treating as keywords, add a double
  splat operator to avoid the warning and ensure correct behavior in
  Ruby 3.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(key: 42); end; foo({key: 42})   # warned
  def foo(**kw);    end; foo({key: 42})   # warned
  def foo(key: 42); end; foo(**{key: 42}) # OK
  def foo(**kw);    end; foo(**{key: 42}) # OK
  {% endhighlight %}

* When a method call passes keywords to a method that accepts keywords,
  but it does not pass enough required positional arguments, the
  keywords are treated as a final required positional argument, and a
  warning is emitted.  Pass the argument as a hash instead of keywords
  to avoid the warning and ensure correct behavior in Ruby 3.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(h, **kw); end; foo(key: 42)      # warned
  def foo(h, key: 42); end; foo(key: 42)   # warned
  def foo(h, **kw); end; foo({key: 42})    # OK
  def foo(h, key: 42); end; foo({key: 42}) # OK
  {% endhighlight %}

* When a method accepts specific keywords but not a keyword splat, and
  a hash or keywords splat is passed to the method that includes both
  Symbol and non-Symbol keys, the hash will continue to be split, and
  a warning will be emitted.  You will need to update the calling code
  to pass separate hashes to ensure correct behavior in Ruby 3.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(h={}, key: 42); end; foo("key" => 43, key: 42)   # warned
  def foo(h={}, key: 42); end; foo({"key" => 43, key: 42}) # warned
  def foo(h={}, key: 42); end; foo({"key" => 43}, key: 42) # OK
  {% endhighlight %}

* If a method does not accept keywords, and is called with keywords,
  the keywords are still treated as a positional hash, with no warning.
  This behavior will continue to work in Ruby 3.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(opt={});  end; foo( key: 42 )   # OK
  {% endhighlight %}

* Non-symbols are allowed as a keyword argument keys if method accepts
  arbitrary keywords.  [[Feature #14183]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14183)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(**kw); p kw; end; foo("str" => 1) #=> {"str"=>1}
  {% endhighlight %}

* <code>**nil</code> is allowed in method definitions to explicitly mark
  that the method accepts no keywords. Calling such a method with keywords
  will result in an ArgumentError.  [[Feature #14183]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14183)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo(h, **nil); end; foo(key: 1)       # ArgumentError
  def foo(h, **nil); end; foo(**{key: 1})   # ArgumentError
  def foo(h, **nil); end; foo("str" => 1)   # ArgumentError
  def foo(h, **nil); end; foo({key: 1})     # OK
  def foo(h, **nil); end; foo({"str" => 1}) # OK
  {% endhighlight %}

* Passing an empty keyword splat to a method that does not accept keywords
  no longer passes an empty hash, unless the empty hash is necessary for
  a required parameter, in which case a warning will be emitted.  Remove
  the double splat to continue passing a positional hash.  [[Feature #14183]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14183)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  h = {}; def foo(*a) a end; foo(**h) # []
  h = {}; def foo(a) a end; foo(**h)  # {} and warning
  h = {}; def foo(*a) a end; foo(h)   # [{}]
  h = {}; def foo(a) a end; foo(h)    # {}
  {% endhighlight %}

## Other Notable New Features

* A method reference operator, <code>.:</code>, is introduced as an experimental feature.  [[Feature #12125]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12125), [[Feature #13581]]( https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13581)

* Numbered parameter as the default block parameter is introduced as an experimental feature.  [[Feature #4475]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4475)

* A beginless range is experimentally introduced.  It might not be as useful
  as an endless range, but would be good for DSL purpose. [[Feature #14799]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14799)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  ary[..3]  # identical to ary[0..3]
  rel.where(sales: ..100)
  {% endhighlight %}

* `Enumerable#tally` is added.  It counts the occurrence of each element.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  ["a", "b", "c", "b"].tally
  #=> {"a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>1}
  {% endhighlight %}

* Calling a private method on `self` is now allowed.  [[Feature #11297]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11297) [[Feature #16123]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16123)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def foo
  end
  private :foo
  self.foo
  {% endhighlight %}

* `Enumerator::Lazy#eager` is added.  It generates a non-lazy enumerator
  from a lazy enumerator.  [[Feature #15901]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15901)

  {% highlight ruby %}
  a = %w(foo bar baz)
  e = a.lazy.map {|x| x.upcase }.map {|x| x + "!" }.eager
  p e.class               #=> Enumerator
  p e.map {|x| x + "?" }  #=> ["FOO!?", "BAR!?", "BAZ!?"]
  {% endhighlight %}

## Performance improvements

* JIT [Experimental]

  * JIT-ed code is recompiled to less-optimized code when an optimization assumption is invalidated.

  * Method inlining is performed when a method is considered as pure. This optimization is still experimental and many methods are NOT considered as pure yet.

  * Default value of `--jit-min-calls` is changed from 5 to 10,000

  * Default value of `--jit-max-cache` is changed from 1,000 to 100

* `Symbol#to_s`, `Module#name`, `true.to_s`, `false.to_s` and `nil.to_s` now always return a frozen String. The returned String is always the same for a given object. [Experimental]  [[Feature #16150]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16150)

* The performance of `CGI.escapeHTML` is improved. [GH-2226](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/2226)

## What is Ruby

Ruby was first developed by Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) in 1993, and is now developed as Open Source. It runs on multiple platforms and is used all over the world especially for web development.
