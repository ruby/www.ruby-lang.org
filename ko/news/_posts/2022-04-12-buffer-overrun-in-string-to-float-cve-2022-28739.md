A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2022-28739](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28739).
We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

## Details

Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some conversion methods like `Kernel#Float` and `String#to_f` could cause buffer over-read.
A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but under limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.

Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.

## Affected versions

* ruby 2.6.9 or prior
* ruby 2.7.5 or prior
* ruby 3.0.3 or prior
* ruby 3.1.1 or prior
