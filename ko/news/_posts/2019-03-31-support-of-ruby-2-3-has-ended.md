We announce that all support of the Ruby 2.3 series has ended.

After the release of Ruby 2.3.7 on March 28, 2018,
the support of the Ruby 2.3 series was in the security maintenance phase.
Now, after one year has passed, this phase has ended.
Therefore, on March 31, 2019, all support of the Ruby 2.3 series ends.
Security and bug fixes from more recent Ruby versions will no longer be
backported to 2.3. There won't be any patches of 2.3 either.
We highly recommend that you upgrade to Ruby 2.6 or 2.5 as soon as possible.

## About currently supported Ruby versions

We will backport bug fixes and release with the fixes whenever necessary.
And, if a critical security issue is found, we will release an urgent fix
for it.

### Ruby 2.5 series

Currently in security maintenance phase.
We will never backport any bug fixes to 2.4 except security fixes.
