Ruby 2.4.6 has been released.

This release includes about 20 bug fixes after the previous release, and also includes several security fixes.
Please check the topics below for details.

* [Multiple vulnerabilities in RubyGems](/en/news/2019/03/05/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-rubygems/)

See the [commit log](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/compare/v2_4_5...v2_4_6) for details.

After this release, we will end the normal maintenance phase of Ruby 2.4,
and start the security maintenance phase of it.
This means that after the release of 2.4.6 we will never backport any bug fixes
to 2.4 except security fixes.
The term of the security maintenance phase is scheduled for 1 year.
By the end of this term, official support of Ruby 2.4 will be over.
Therefore, we recommend that you start planning to upgrade to Ruby 2.6 or 2.5.
