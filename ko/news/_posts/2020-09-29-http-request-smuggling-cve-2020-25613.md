A potential HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in WEBrick was reported. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE idenfitifer [CVE-2020-25613](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25613). We strongly recommend upgrading the webrick gem.

## Details

WEBrick was too tolerant against an invalid Transfer-Encoding header. This may lead to inconsistent interpretation between WEBrick and some HTTP proxy servers, which may allow the attacker to "smuggle" a request. See [CWE-444](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html) in detail.

Please update the webrick gem to version 1.6.1 or later.  You can use `gem update webrick` to update it.  If you are using bundler, please add `gem "webrick", ">= 1.6.1"` to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* webrick gem 1.6.0 or prior
* bundled versions of webrick in ruby 2.7.1 or prior
* bundled versions of webrick in ruby 2.6.6 or prior
* bundled versions of webrick in ruby 2.5.8 or prior
