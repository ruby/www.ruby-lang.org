### Ways of Installing Ruby

We have several tools on each major platform to install Ruby:

* On Linux/UNIX, you can use the package management system of your
  distribution or third-party tools ([rbenv][rbenv] and [RVM][rvm]).
* On macOS machines, you can use third-party tools ([rbenv][rbenv] and [RVM][rvm]).
* On Windows machines, you can use [RubyInstaller][rubyinstaller].

See the [Installation][installation] page for details on using
package management systems or third-party tools.

Of course, you can also install Ruby from source on all major platforms.

### Compiling Ruby — Source Code

Installing from the source code is a great solution for when you are
comfortable enough with your platform and perhaps need specific settings
for your environment. It’s also a good solution in the event that there
are no other premade packages for your platform.

See the [Installation][installation] page for details on building
Ruby from source. If you have an issue compiling Ruby, consider using
one of the third party tools mentioned above. They may help you.

* **Snapshots:**
  * [Stable Snapshot]({{ site.data.downloads.stable_snapshot.url.gz }}):
    This is a tarball of the latest snapshot of the current stable branch.
  * [Nightly Snapshot]({{ site.data.downloads.nightly_snapshot.url.gz }}):
    This is a tarball of whatever is in SVN, made nightly.
    This may contain bugs or other issues, use at your own risk!

For more information about specific releases, particularly older releases
or previews, see the [Releases page][releases].
Information about the current maintenance status of the various
Ruby branches can be found on the [Branches page][branches].
