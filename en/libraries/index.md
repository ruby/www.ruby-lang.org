As most programming languages, Ruby leverages a wide set of third-party
libraries.

Most of them are released in the form of a **gem**. [**RubyGems**][1] is
a Ruby packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and
installation of libraries (in some ways, it is a distribution packaging
system similar to, say, `apt-get`, but targeted at Ruby software).
Since version 1.9 Ruby comes with RubyGems by default, while previous
Ruby versions require to [install it by hand][2].

Some other libraries are released as archived (.zip or .tar.gz)
directories of **source code**. Installation processes may vary,
typically a `README` or `INSTALL` file is available with instructions.

Let’s take a look at finding libraries and installing them for your own
use.

### Finding libraries

The main place where libraries are hosted is [**RubyGems.org**][3],
providing Ruby libs as gems. You may browse the website directly, or use
the `gem` command.

Using `gem search -r`, you can inspect RubyGems' repository. For
instance, `gem search -r rails` will return a list of Rails-related
gems. With the `--local` (`-l`) option, you would perform a local
search through your installed gems. To install a gem, use `gem install
[gem]`. Browsing installed gems is done with `gem list`. For more
information about the `gem` command, see below or head to [RubyGems’
docs][1].

There are other sources of libraries though. [RubyForge][4] used to be a
popular home for Ruby libraries, but last years saw the rise of
[**GitHub**][5] as one of the main ruby-related content repository. Most
often a gem source code will be hosted on GitHub while being published
as a fully-fledged gem to RubyGems.org.

[**The Ruby Toolbox**][6] is a project that makes it easy to explore open source
Ruby projects. It has categories for various common development tasks, collects
a lot of information about the projects like release and commit activity or dependencies,
and rates projects based on their popularity on RubyGems.org and GitHub.
The search makes it easy to find what you are looking for.

### A few more words about RubyGems

Here is a quick review of the `gem` command for your daily use. [More
detailed documentation][7] is available, covering all aspects of this
packaging system.

#### Searching among available gems

The **search** command can be used to look for gems, based on a string.
Gems which names start with the specified string will be listed in return.
For instance, to search for the “html”-related gems:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem search -r html

*** REMOTE GEMS ***

html-sample (1.0, 1.1)
{% endhighlight %}

The `--remote` / `-r` flag indicates that we want to inspect the
official RubyGems.org repository (default behaviour).
With the `--local` / `-l` flag you would perform a local search
among your installed gems.

#### Installing a gem

Once you know which gem you would like to **install**, for instance the
popular Rails:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem install rails
{% endhighlight %}

You can even install just a certain version of the library, using the
`--version` / `-v` flag:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem install rails --version 3.0
{% endhighlight %}

#### Listing all gems

For a **list** of all locally installed gems:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem list
{% endhighlight %}

To obtain a (very long) list of all gems available on RubyGems.org:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem list -r
{% endhighlight %}

#### Help!

Documentation is available inside your terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem help
{% endhighlight %}

For instance, `gem help commands` is very useful as it outputs a list of
all `gem`’s commands.

#### Crafting your own gems

RubyGems.org has [several guides][8] about this topic. You may also want
to investigate on [Bundler][9], a generic tool which helps you manage an
application’s dependencies and may be used along RubyGems.
