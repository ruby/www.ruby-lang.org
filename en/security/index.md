## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities should be reported via an email to
security@ruby-lang.org ([the PGP public key](/security.asc)), which is a
private mailing list. Reported problems will be published after fixes.

The members of the mailing list are people who provide Ruby
(Ruby committers and authors of other Ruby implementations,
distributors, PaaS platformers).
The members must be individual people, mailing lists are not permitted.
