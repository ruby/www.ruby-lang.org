Mailing-lists are a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of the
Ruby community.
{: .summary}

Ruby has four primary English speaking mailing lists:

Ruby-Talk
: This is the most popular mailing-list and deals with general topics
  about Ruby. ([Archives][3], [Posting Guidelines][guidelines], [Community Archive][rubytalk])

Ruby-Core
: This list deals with core and implementation topics about Ruby, often
  used to run patches for review. ([Archives][4])

Ruby-Doc
: This list is for discussing documentation standards and tools for
  Ruby. ([Archives][5])

Ruby-CVS
: This list reports all commits to Ruby’s Subversion repository.

The comp.lang.ruby Newsgroup
: Those who prefer Usenet over mailing lists will want to checkout the
  [comp.lang.ruby](news:comp.lang.ruby) newsgroup. ([FAQ][clrFAQ])

See [https://ml.ruby-lang.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/](https://ml.ruby-lang.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/)
for more information about all mailing lists on ruby-lang.org,
including the lists in Japanese language.
