If you are interested in getting involved, here are a couple of places
to start:

  programmers. Ruby user groups are self-organizing and typically
  feature monthly meetings, a mailing list, a Web site, and if you are
  lucky, frequent codefests.

[Ruby Mailing Lists and Newsgroups](mailing-lists/)

  languages. If you have questions about Ruby, asking them on a mailing
  list is a great way to get answers.
