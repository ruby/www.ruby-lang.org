The community that grows up around a programming language is one of its
most important strengths. Ruby has a vibrant and growing community that
is friendly towards people of all skill levels.

If you are interested in getting involved, here are a couple of places
to start:

[Ruby User Groups](user-groups/)
: Your local Ruby user group is a great place to network with other Ruby
  programmers. Ruby user groups are self-organizing and typically
  feature monthly meetings, a mailing list, a Web site, and if you are
  lucky, frequent codefests.

[Ruby Mailing Lists and Newsgroups](mailing-lists/)
: Ruby has an assortment of lists on different topics and in several
  languages. If you have questions about Ruby, asking them on a mailing
  list is a great way to get answers.

[Ruby on IRC (#ruby)](irc://irc.freenode.net/ruby)
: The Ruby Language IRC Channel is a wonderful way to chat with fellow
  Rubyists.

[Ruby Core](ruby-core/)
: Now is a fantastic time to follow Ruby’s development.
  If you are interested in helping with Ruby, start here.

[Weblogs About Ruby](weblogs/)
: Very little happens in the Ruby community that is not talked about on
  the blogs. We’ve got a nice list of suggestions for you here for
  getting plugged in.

[Ruby Conferences](conferences/)
: Ruby programmers around the world are getting involved in more and
  more conferences, where they get together to share reports on
  work-in-progress, discuss the future of Ruby, and welcome newcomers to
  the Ruby community.
