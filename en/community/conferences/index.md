Ruby programmers around the world are getting involved in more and more
conferences, where they get together to share reports on
work-in-progress, discuss the future of Ruby, and welcome newcomers to
the Ruby community.

[RubyEvents.org][rc] is a simple list of Ruby-specific conferences,
published collaboratively with the Ruby community. There you will find
event dates, location, CFP (Call For Proposals) and Registration information.


### Major Ruby Conferences

[RubyConf][1]
: Every year since 2001, [Ruby Central, Inc.][2] has produced RubyConf,
  the International Ruby conference. RubyConf has provided a forum for presentations
  about Ruby technologies by their creators

[RubyKaigi][3]
: The first Japanese Ruby conference, RubyKaigi 2006, took place in
  Odaiba. RubyKaigi provides many new and exciting talks by Matz and
  other Rubyists in every year.

[EuRuKo <small>(European Ruby Conference)</small>][4]
: The first annual European Ruby Conference (EuRuKo) was held in
  Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2003. Organized by a team of German Rubyists
  including Armin Roehrl and Michael Neumann, EuRuKo emerged as the
  second annual Ruby event, starting two years after RubyConf.
