  is a Ruby news site with links to libraries, blog posts, tutorials,
  and other Ruby resources.

### Blogs of Note

A few notable blogs stand out for the frequency and immediacy of their
updates.

  tagged Ruby within the DEV Community. DEV is a network of thousands
  of software developers who blog about and discuss code.

  of the recent work being done to advance both Ruby and Rails.
