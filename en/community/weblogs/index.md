Ruby blogs have exploded over the past year and given sufficient
hunting, you can unearth hundreds of blogs sharing bits of Ruby code,
describing new techniques, or speculating on Ruby’s future.

### Mining for Ruby Blogs

* [**RubyFlow**][rubyflow], “the Ruby and Rails community linklog”,
  is a Ruby news site with links to libraries, blog posts, tutorials,
  and other Ruby resources.
* [**Rubyland**][rubyland] aggregates news and blog posts about Ruby
  from RSS feeds.

### Blogs of Note

A few notable blogs stand out for the frequency and immediacy of their
updates.

* [**Ruby Weekly**][ruby-weekly] Although more of a newsletter than a
  blog, Ruby Weekly is a distillation of the most interesting Ruby
  articles and news each week.
* [**Riding Rails**][riding-rails] is the official group blog of the
  Ruby on Rails team. If you are running Rails, this blog is essential
  for notification of security updates and an overall view of the wide
  Rails community.

### Spreading the Word

You can contact the authors of the above blogs, if you are covering a
topic they’d be interested in.

Ruby is also a common topic on [reddit][reddit], and [Hacker News][hn],
in their respective programming news. If you find some brilliant code
out there, be sure to let them know!
