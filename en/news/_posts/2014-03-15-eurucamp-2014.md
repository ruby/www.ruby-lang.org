[eurucamp 2014][1] will be held around Berlin on August 1st to 3rd.
eurucamp is an offspring of EuRuKo 2011 and has been held ever since.

The [Call for Proposals][2] is open until May 1st.
The CFP is anonymous and fair, all speaking slots will be filled through it. In
addition to that, eurucamp has an
[unconditional mentorship program][3].

We are searching for both talks and workshops about Ruby and the community.
We are very welcoming towards new speakers or seasoned speakers trying out new topics.
Find details in our [CFP guide][4].

eurucamp is a summer conference with ample free time for socializing and many
opportunities to come up with your own ideas. See our
[2012 video][5] on our [Vimeo page][6]
for an impression. Also have a look at our [activities app][7]
as a sample of what happens in and around eurucamp.

eurucamp has a strict [Code of Conduct][8]. We are family friendly and
offer child care. We welcome anyone with accessibility issues.

We are an international conference and have seen guests from all around the world.

Ticket sales will open soon.
