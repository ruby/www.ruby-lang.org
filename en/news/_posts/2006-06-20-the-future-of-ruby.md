There has been much discussion recently on the future directions Ruby
will be exploring, with some official plans coming from Matz himself. If
you are interested to know what’s coming, check out the following links:

* [Changes in Ruby 1.9][1]
* [1.8.5 Delivery Schedule][2]
* [Matz’s Weird and Wild Ideas][3]

Please remember that Ruby will continue to grow and change. The above
information is only what we think we know at this point in that process.
