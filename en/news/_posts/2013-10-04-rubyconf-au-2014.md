[RubyConf Australia 2014][1] will be held in Sydney on February 19 to 21. It will be the second Ruby conference held in Australia.

The Call For Proposals is open until October 31. Proposals will be by Github pull request, like EuRuKo and Sapporo RubyKaigi.

"Egg" (pre early-bird) tickets are available until October 28. Scholarships to attend the event are also available.

Our first conference had many speakers from overseas, but also local speakers you may not have seen before.
The topics were very diverse and the talks were enlightening.
We also had a variety of workshops, and afterwards people socialized and explored the city it was hosted in.

You can get additional information by following us on twitter at [@rubyconf_au][2], subscribing to our mailing list, or viewing 2013's talks on Vimeo.

We hope to see you there!
