Ruby 2.6.10 has been released.

This release includes a security fix.
Please check the topics below for details.

* [CVE-2022-28739: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion]({%link en/news/_posts/2022-04-12-buffer-overrun-in-string-to-float-cve-2022-28739.md %})

This release also includes a fix of a build problem with very old compilers and a fix of a regression of date library.
See the [commit logs](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/compare/v2_6_9...v2_6_10) for further details.

After this release, Ruby 2.6 reaches EOL. In other words, this is expected to be the last release of Ruby 2.6 series.
We will not release Ruby 2.6.11 even if a security vulnerability is found (but could release if a severe regression is found).
We recommend all Ruby 2.6 users to start migration to Ruby 3.1, 3.0, or 2.7 immediately.
