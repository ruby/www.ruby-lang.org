Some services provided by ruby-lang.org are stopped,
because the servers of ruby-lang.org are currently down.

Impact is as follows:

 * All mailing lists provided by ruby-lang.org are down.
 * Ruby's tar packages distributed by ftp.ruby-lang.org are unreachable.
 * If you lookup old DNS cache, you cannot reach www.ruby-lang.org.

We are repairing these services now.

## Update (2013-08-06 9:33 UTC)

The reason of today's problems is a hardware failure.
We repaired the following issues:

 * All mailing lists are back, but we still have some problem. We are repairing it.
 * ftp.ruby-lang.org is available again via http and ftp.

If you discover other problems, please report them to
https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/issues.

## Update (2013-08-06 13:18 UTC)

We stopped ftp.ruby-lang.org via http and ftp, because some old packages of Ruby is broken. MD5 doesn't match as expected.

We are investigating now. Detail infomation is following issue.
