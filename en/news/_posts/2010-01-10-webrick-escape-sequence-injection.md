title: "WEBrick has an Escape Sequence Injection vulnerability"
author: "Urabe Shyouhei"
lang: en

A vulnerability was found on WEBrick, a part of Ruby\'s standard
library. WEBrick lets attackers to inject malicious escape sequences to
its logs, making it possible for dangerous control characters to be
executed on a victim\'s terminal emulator.

We already have a fix for it. Releases for every active branches are to
follow this announce. But for a meantime, we recommend you to avoid
looking at your WEBrick logs, until you update your WEBrick process.

## Detailed description

Terminal escape sequences are used to allow various forms of interaction
between a terminal and a inside process. The problem is that those
sequences are not intended to be issued by untrusted sources; such as
network inputs. So if a remote attacker could inject escape sequences
into WEBrick logs, and a victim happen to consult them through his/her
terminal, the attacker could take advantages of various [weaknesses in
terminal emulators][1].

And WEBrick fails to filter those terminal escape sequences.

Example:

    % xterm -e ruby -rwebrick -e 'WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port=>8080).start' &
    % wget http://localhost:8080/%1b%5d%32%3b%6f%77%6e%65%64%07%0a

Watch out for the window title of xterm.
