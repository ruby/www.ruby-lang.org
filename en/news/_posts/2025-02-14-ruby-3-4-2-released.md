Ruby 3.4.2 has been released.

This is a routine update that includes bug fixes. Please refer to the
[release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/releases/tag/v3_4_2) for further details.

## Release Schedule

We intend to release the latest stable Ruby version (currently Ruby 3.4) every 2 months.
Ruby 3.4.3 will be released in April, 3.4.4 in June, 3.4.5 in August, 3.4.6 in October, and 3.4.7 in December.
If there's any change that affects a considerable amount of people, those versions may be released earlier than expected.
