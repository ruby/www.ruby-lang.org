We decided to suspend to raa.ruby-lang.org as known as "Ruby Application Archive". Because we have no server and human resources for provide raa.ruby-lang.org. If you want to see raa.ruby-lan.org, Please visit http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://raa.ruby-lang.org/ 

"Ruby Application Archive" was born at 1997. It was moved to raa.ruby-lang.org at 2003 and introduced a lot of useful libraries. Please use http://rubygems.org and http://www.ruby-toolbox.com later. Thanks.
