We'd like to take a minute and discuss our plans for ruby-core supported maintenance periods of Ruby.

For context, you should read our recent policy changes for [semantic versioning](/en/news/2013/12/21/semantic-versioning-after-2-1-0).

Given the previously mentioned versioning scheme, ruby-core aims to support the following policy:

  * `MINOR`: With "best effort" goal with at least 6 months and at best 3 years.
  * `TEENY`: Will be released approximately every 2-3 months

During this time, the ruby-core team will support maintained versions of Ruby for general bug fixes until a decision is made to end support. At which point, security maintenance will continue until the version is End-of-Life.

The ruby-core team is responsible for a proper End-of-Life for each `MINOR` version of Ruby.

Our current format is to assign a maintainer for each `MINOR` series of Ruby. It's important to note that this person is not obligated to commit for the entire 3 year suggested maintenance period.

Our main goal to avoid sudden death.

Thank you for your support as we continue to provide a stable and healthy Ruby.
