Ruby 3.3.5 has been released.

This is a routine update that includes minor bug fixes.
We recommend upgrading your Ruby version at your earliest convenience.
For more details, please refer to the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/releases/tag/v3_3_5).

## Release Schedule

As previously [announced](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/07/09/ruby-3-3-4-released/), we intend to release the latest stable Ruby version (currently Ruby 3.3) every 2 months following a `.1` release.

We expect to release Ruby 3.3.6 on November 5th and Ruby 3.3.7 on January 7th. If any significant changes arise that impact a large number of users, we may release a new version earlier than scheduled.
