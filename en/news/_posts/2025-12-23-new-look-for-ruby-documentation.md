Following the [ruby-lang.org redesign](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2025/12/22/redesign-site-identity/), we have more news to celebrate Ruby's 30th anniversary: [docs.ruby-lang.org][ruby-doc] has a completely new look with Aliki—[RDoc](https://github.com/ruby/rdoc)'s new default theme.

## A Fresh Look for Ruby Documentation

Ruby has always been a joy to write, and now reading Ruby documentation can match that experience. Aliki brings a modern, clean design to [docs.ruby-lang.org][ruby-doc] and any gem that generates documentation with RDoc v7.0+.

## Key Features

- **Improved search**: Case-aware ranking, fuzzy matching, and support for searching constants
- **Dark mode**: Respects your OS preference with a manual toggle
- **Three-column layout**: Left sidebar for navigation, center for content, right sidebar for table of contents
- **Code block improvements**: Copy buttons on code blocks and C syntax highlighting
- **Customizable footer**: Gem maintainers can add links to their repository, issue tracker, and other resources

## For Gem Authors

If you generate documentation with RDoc 7.0+, your users will see Aliki automatically. You can customize footer links or switch back to the Darkfish theme in your `.rdoc_options` file.

## Try It Out

See the new look in action at [docs.ruby-lang.org][ruby-doc].
