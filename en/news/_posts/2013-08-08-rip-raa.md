We decided to suspend raa.ruby-lang.org, also known as
"Ruby Application Archive (RAA)".
We have no server or human resources to continue hosting raa.ruby-lang.org.
If you still need to browse raa.ruby-lang.org, please visit
[RAA in the Internet Archive][1].

The "Ruby Application Archive" was first started in 1997.
It moved to raa.ruby-lang.org in 2003 and introduced a lot of
useful libraries to Rubyists.
Please use [RubyGems.org][2] and [The Ruby Toolbox][3] instead.
Thanks.
