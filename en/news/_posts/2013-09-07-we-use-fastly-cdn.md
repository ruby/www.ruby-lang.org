ruby-lang.org started to provide http://cache.ruby-lang.org for
distributing official Ruby source packages.
We can now fastly distribute packages all over the world
using a content delivery network (CDN).

This CDN is provided by the open source plan of [Fastly][1].
Many thanks to Fastly for their support.
