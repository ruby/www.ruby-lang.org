Ruby 1.9.3-p547 has just been released.

Ruby 1.9.3 is now in the security maintenance phase.
This means that we release Ruby 1.9.3 only when a security incident occurs.
However, there is one exception.
As stated previously, we release if a critical regression is found.

Some users reported problems in environments that use an old OpenSSL version,
such as Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
This is a regression introduced in Ruby 1.9.3-p545.
(The same problem also occurred in Ruby 2.1.1 and Ruby 2.0.0-p451 and has
already been fixed with Ruby 2.1.2 and Ruby 2.0.0-p481.)
Please look at [Bug #9592](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9592) for more details.

So, we decided to release this fix.
You should only upgrade if you are affected by this problem.

This release includes only two changes:

* a fix for an old OpenSSL version (see above),
* a trivial change of `common.mk` for our release management (does not affect users).
