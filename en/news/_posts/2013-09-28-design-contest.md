The Ruby Association will be hosting a design contest for the new design of
ruby-lang.org.

ruby-lang.org has switched its platform from Radiant CMS to Jekyll in
spring 2013. Everyone can now edit the content through GitHub. How about that?
However, the current design is built for the typical size of a desktop or
laptop but not for smartphones and tablets. We still need more work for the
design!

Ruby's 20th anniversary this year seems like an appropriate occasion for
a call to submit design ideas for ruby-lang.org.
Please read the [instructions][1] and send your design entry.
