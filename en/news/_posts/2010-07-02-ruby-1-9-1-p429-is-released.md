Ruby 1.9.1-p429 has just been released. This is a patchlevel release for
Ruby 1.9.1. This fixes many bugs and includes the fix for a security
vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary code.

## Vulnerability

### Description

A security vulnerability that causes buffer overflow when you assign a
danger value to `ARGF.inplace_mode` on Windows. It possibly allows an
attacker to execute an arbitrary code.

The affected versions are:

* Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel 378 and all prior versions;
* Ruby 1.9.2 preview 3 and all prior versions;
* Development versions of Ruby 1.9 (1.9.3dev).

I recommend you to upgrade your ruby 1.9 to 1.9.1-p429 or 1.9.2-rc1.

The vulnerability does not directly affect to Ruby 1.8 series.
