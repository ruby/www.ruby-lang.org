## Notes

### Incompatibility

There are three notable incompatibilities we know of:

* The default encoding for ruby scripts is now UTF-8 [\[#6679\]][10].
  Some people report that it affects existing programs, such as some
  benchmark programs becoming very slow [\[ruby-dev:46547\]][11]. The
  spec may change for the official release.
* iconv was removed, which had already been deprecated when M17N was
  introduced in ruby 1.9. Use String#encode, etc. instead.
* There is ABI breakage [\[ruby-core:48984\]][12]. We think that normal
  users can/should just reinstall extension libraries. You should be
  aware: \"DO NOT COPY .so OR .bundle FILES FROM 1.9\".

There are some comparatively small incompatibilities.
[\[ruby-core:49119\]][13] Please report any other incompatibility you
notice.

FYI: We are creating upgrade notes, but some parts are already outdated.

* [&lt;URL:https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby/wiki/200UpgradeNotesDraft&gt;][14]

### Status of Refinements

2\.0.0 will include refinements as an \"experimental feature\" because we
could not agree on its detailed spec. Note that the behavior may change
in future versions of Ruby.

### Special thanks

I appreciate all who try preview and rc1 release! I\'m grateful for all
the contributors\' hard work to fix many bugs. I\'m really thankful to
all the people who helped me do this release.
