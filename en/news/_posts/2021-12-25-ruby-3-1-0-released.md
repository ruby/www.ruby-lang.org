We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby {{ release.version }}.


## YJIT: New experimental in-process JIT compiler


Ruby 3.1 merges YJIT, a new in-process JIT compiler developed by Shopify.

Since [Ruby 2.6 introduced MJIT in 2018](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/), its performance greatly improved, and finally [we achieved Ruby3x3 last year](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/). But even though Optcarrot has shown impressive speedups, the JIT hasn't benefited real world business applications.

Recently Shopify contributed many Ruby improvements to speed up their Rails application. YJIT is an important contribution, and aims to improve the performance of Rails applications.

Though MJIT is a method-based JIT compiler and uses an external C compiler, YJIT uses Basic Block Versioning and includes JIT compiler inside it. With Lazy Basic Block Versioning (LBBV) it first compiles the beginning of a method, and incrementally compiles the rest when the type of arguments and variables are dynamically determined. See [YJIT: a basic block versioning JIT compiler for CRuby](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486606.3486781) for a detailed introduction.

With this technology, YJIT achieves both fast warmup time and performance improvements on most real-world software, up to 22% on railsbench, 39% on liquid-render.

YJIT is still an experimental feature, and as such, it is disabled by default. If you want to use this, specify the `--yjit` command-line option to enable YJIT. It is also limited to Unix-like x86-64 platforms for now.

## debug gem: A new debugger

A completely rewritten debugger [debug.gem](https://github.com/ruby/debug) is bundled. debug.gem has the following features:

* Improve the debugging performance (it does not slow down the application even with the debugger)
* Support remote debugging
* Support rich debugging frontend (VSCode and Chrome browser are supported now)
* Support multi-process/multi-thread debugging
* Colorful REPL
* And other useful features like recod & replay feature, tracing feature and so on.

</video>

Ruby had bundled lib/debug.rb, but it was not well maintained and it had issues about performance and features. debug.gem replaced lib/debug.rb completely.

## error_highlight: Fine-grained error location in backtrace

A built-in gem, error_highlight, has been introduced. It includes fine-grained error location in backtrace:

```
$ ruby test.rb
test.rb:1:in `<main>': undefined method `time' for 1:Integer (NoMethodError)

1.time {}
 ^^^^^
Did you mean?  times
```

Currently, only `NameError` is supported.

This gem is enabled by default. You can disable it by using a command-line option `--disable-error_highlight`. See [the repository](https://github.com/ruby/error_highlight) in detail.

## IRB Autocomplete and Document Display

The IRB now has an autocomplete feature, where you can just type in the code, and the completion candidates dialog will appear. You can use Tab and Shift+Tab to move up and down.

If documents are installed when you select a completion candidate, the documentation dialog will appear next to the completion candidates dialog, showing part of the content. You can read the full document by pressing Alt+d.

## Other Notable New Features

### Language

* Values in Hash literals and keyword arguments can be omitted. [Feature #14579]
  * `{x:, y:}` is a syntax sugar of `{x: x, y: y}`.
  * `foo(x:, y:)` is a syntax sugar of `foo(x: x, y: y)`.

* Pin operator in pattern matching now takes an expression. [Feature #17411]

```ruby
Prime.each_cons(2).lazy.find_all{_1 in [n, ^(n + 2)]}.take(3).to_a
#=> [[3, 5], [5, 7], [11, 13]]
```

* Parentheses can be omitted in one-line pattern matching. [Feature #16182]

```ruby
[0, 1] => _, x
{y: 2} => y:
x #=> 1
y #=> 2
```

### RBS

RBS is a language to describe the structure of Ruby programs. See [the repository](https://github.com/ruby/rbs) for details.

Updates since Ruby 3.0.0:

* Generic type parameters can be bounded. ([PR](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/844))
* Generic type aliases are supported. ([PR](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/pull/823))
* `rbs collection` has been introduced to manage gems' RBSs.  ([doc](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/blob/master/docs/collection.md))
* Many signatures for built-in and standard libraries have been added/updated.
* It includes many bug fixes and performance improvements too.

See [the CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

### TypeProf

TypeProf is a static type analyzer for Ruby. It generates a prototype of RBS from non-type-annotated Ruby code. See [the document](https://github.com/ruby/typeprof/blob/master/doc/doc.md) for detail.

The main updates since Ruby 3.0.0 is an experimental IDE support called "TypeProf for IDE".

![Demo of TypeProf for IDE](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/media/ruby310_typeprof_ide_demo.png)

The vscode extension shows a guessed (or explicitly written in a RBS file) method signature above each method definition, draws a red underline under the code that may cause a name error or type error, and completes method names (i.e., shows method candidates). See [the document](https://github.com/ruby/typeprof/blob/master/doc/ide.md) in detail.

Also, the release includes many bug fixes and performance improvements.

## Performance improvements

* MJIT
  * For workloads like Rails, the default `--jit-max-cache` is changed from 100 to 10000.
    The JIT compiler no longer skips compilation of methods longer than 1000 instructions.
  * To support Zeitwerk of Rails, JIT-ed code is no longer cancelled
    when a TracePoint for class events is enabled.

## Other notable changes since 3.0

* One-line pattern matching, e.g., `ary => [x, y, z]`, is no longer experimental.
* Multiple assignment evaluation order has been changed slightly. [[Bug #4443]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4443)
  * `foo[0], bar[0] = baz, qux` was evaluated in order `baz`, `qux`, `foo`, and then `bar` in Ruby 3.0. In Ruby 3.1, it is evaluated in order `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, and then `qux`.
* Variable Width Allocation: Strings (experimental) [[Bug #18239]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18239)

* Psych 4.0 changes `Psych.load` as `safe_load` by the default.
  You may need to use Psych 3.3.2 for migrating to this behavior.
  [[Bug #17866]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17866)

## What is Ruby

Ruby was first developed by Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) in 1993,
and is now developed as Open Source. It runs on multiple platforms
and is used all over the world especially for web development.
