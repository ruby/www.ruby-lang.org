We have released the uri gem version 0.12.1, 0.11.1, 0.10.2 and 0.10.0.1 that has a security fix for a ReDoS vulnerability.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2023-28755](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28755).

## Details

A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. It causes an increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects.

The `uri` gem version 0.12.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.0 and all versions prior 0.10.0 are vulnerable for this vulnerability.

## Recommended action

We recommend to update the `uri` gem to 0.12.1. In order to ensure compatibility with bundled version in older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:

* For Ruby 2.7: Update to `uri` 0.10.0.1
* For Ruby 3.0: Update to `uri` 0.10.2
* For Ruby 3.1: Update to `uri` 0.11.1
* For Ruby 3.2: Update to `uri` 0.12.1

You can use `gem update uri` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "uri", ">= 0.12.1"` (or other version mentioned above) to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* uri gem 0.12.0
* uri gem 0.11.0
* uri gem 0.10.1
* uri gem 0.10.0 or before
