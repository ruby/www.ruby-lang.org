Ruby 3.4.6 has been released.

This is a routine update that includes bug fixes.
Please refer to the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/releases/tag/v3_4_6) for further details.

## Release Schedule

We intend to release the latest stable Ruby version (currently Ruby 3.4) every two months following the most recent release.
Ruby 3.4.7 is scheduled for November and 3.4.8 for January.

If a change arises that significantly affects users, a release may occur earlier than planned, and the subsequent schedule may shift accordingly.
