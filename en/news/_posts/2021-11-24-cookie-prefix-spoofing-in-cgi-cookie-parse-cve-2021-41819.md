A cookie prefix spoofing vulnerability was discovered in CGI::Cookie.parse.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2021-41819](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41819).
We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

## Details

The old versions of `CGI::Cookie.parse` applied URL decoding to cookie names.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof security prefixes in cookie names, which may be able to trick a vulnerable application.

By this fix, `CGI::Cookie.parse` no longer decodes cookie names.
Note that this is an incompatibility if cookie names that you are using include non-alphanumeric characters that are URL-encoded.

This is the same issue of [CVE-2020-8184](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8184).

If you are using Ruby 2.7 or 3.0:

* Please update the cgi gem to version 0.3.1, 0.2,1, and 0.1,1 or later. You can use `gem update cgi` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "cgi", ">= 0.3.1"` to your `Gemfile`.
* Alternatively, please update Ruby to 2.7.5 or 3.0.3.

If you are using Ruby 2.6:

* Please update Ruby to 2.6.9. *You cannot use `gem update cgi` for Ruby 2.6 or prior.*

## Affected versions

* ruby 2.6.8 or prior (You can *not* use `gem update cgi` for this version.)
* cgi gem 0.1.0 or prior (which are bundled versions with Ruby 2.7 series prior to Ruby 2.7.5)
* cgi gem 0.2.0 or prior (which are bundled versions with Ruby 3.0 series prior to Ruby 3.0.3)
