Today we would like to officially announce our plans for the 1.9.3 version of Ruby.

**1.9.3 will be End of Life in March 2014**

Currently this branch is in security maintenance mode, and will remain so until
this coming Spring.

1.9.3 remains a commission by the [Ruby Association](http://www.ruby.or.jp/)
and may be renewed in March for an additional 3 months. However due to the
uncertainty of this, we highly recommend you upgrade to Ruby 2.0.0 as soon as
possible.

## Thank you!

When 1.9.3 was originally released [over 2 years
ago](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/10/31/ruby-1-9-3-p0-is-released/)
we witnessed many [signifigant
improvements](http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_9_3_0/NEWS).

I would like to personally thank Usaku Nakamura
([@unak](https://twitter.com/unak)) for maintaining 1.9.3, and all of the
contributors to the 1.9 series.
