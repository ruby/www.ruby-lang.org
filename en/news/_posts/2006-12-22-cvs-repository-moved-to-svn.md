We have moved the source code repository to
[https://git.ruby-lang.org/ruby.git][1]. You can checkout it using the
svn command, or you can also browse it by [ViewVC][2].

The new machine for svn.ruby-lang.org is provided by [Sun
Microsystems][3]. We are using [Solaris 10][4] on the new machine, and
it works pretty well.
