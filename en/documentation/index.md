### Installing Ruby

Although you can easily [try Ruby in your browser][1], you can also read
the [installation guide](installation/) for help on installing Ruby.

### Getting Started

[Official FAQ](/en/documentation/faq/)
: The official frequently asked questions.

[Ruby Koans][2]

  Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and
  some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture.

[Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby][5]
: An unconventional but interesting book that will teach you Ruby
  through stories, wit, and comics. Originally created by *why the lucky
  stiff*, this guide remains a classic for Ruby learners.

[Learning Ruby][6]
: A thorough collection of Ruby study notes for those who are new to the
  language and in search of a solid introduction to Ruby’s concepts and
  constructs.

[Ruby Essentials][7]
: Ruby Essentials is a free on-line book designed to provide a concise
  and easy to follow guide to learning Ruby.

[Learn to Program][8]
: A wonderful little tutorial by Chris Pine for programming newbies. If
  you don’t know how to program, start here.

[Learn Ruby the Hard Way][38]
: A very good set of exercises with explanations that guide you from
  the absolute basics of Ruby all the way to OOP and web development.

### Manuals

[Programming Ruby][9]
: The seminal work on Ruby in English, this first edition of the
  [Pragmatic Programmers’ book][10] is available for free online.

[Ruby User’s Guide][11]

  Matsumoto (the creator of Ruby), this version, by Goto Kentaro and
  Mark Slagell, is a nice overview of many aspects of the Ruby language.

[The Ruby Programming Wikibook][12]
: A free online manual with beginner and intermediate content plus a
  thorough language reference.

### Reference Documentation

[Official API Documentation][docs-rlo-en]
: The official Ruby API documentation for different versions including
  the currently unreleased (trunk) version.

[Ruby Core Reference][13]
: Pulled straight from the source code using [RDoc][14], this reference
  work documents all of the core classes and modules (like String,
  Array, Symbol, etc…).

[Ruby Standard Library Reference][15]
: Also pulled from the source code using RDoc, this reference work
  documents the standard library.

[Ruby C API Reference][extensions]
: The official introduction to Ruby's C API.
  Great if you want to write C extensions
  or contribute to Ruby’s development.

[RubyDoc.info][16]
: The one-stop web site for reference documentation about Ruby gems and
  GitHub-hosted Ruby projects.

[Ruby & Rails Searchable API Docs][17]
: Rails and Ruby documentation with smart searching.

[APIdock][18]
: Ruby, Rails and RSpec documentation with users’ notes.

### Editors and IDEs

For coding in Ruby, you can use the default editor of your operating
system. By the way, to be more effective in coding, it is worth choosing a source code editor with basic Ruby support (e.g.
syntax-highlighting, file browsing) or an integrated development
environment with advanced features (e.g. code completion, refactoring,
testing support).

Here is a list of popular tools used by Rubyists:

* Linux and cross-platform tools:
  * [Aptana Studio][19]
  * [Emacs][20] with [Ruby mode][21] and [Rsense][22]
  * [Geany][23]
  * [gedit][24]
  * [Vim][25] with [vim-ruby][26] plugin and [Rsense][22]
  * [RubyMine][27]
  * [SciTe][28]
  * [NetBeans][36]
  * [Sublime Text][37]
  * [Atom][atom]
  * [Visual Studio Code][vscode]

* On Windows:
  * [Notepad++][29]
  * [E-TextEditor][30]
  * [Ruby In Steel][31]

* On macOS:
  * [TextMate][32]
  * [TextWrangler][33]
