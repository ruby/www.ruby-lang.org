### Installing Ruby

Unless you only want to try Ruby in the browser (see the links below)
you need to have Ruby installed on your computer.
You can check whether Ruby already is available by opening a terminal
and typing

{% highlight sh %}
ruby -v
{% endhighlight %}

This should output some information on the installed Ruby version.
If not, see the [installation page](installation/) for various options
of getting Ruby.

### Editors and IDEs

For coding in Ruby you can use the default editor of your operating
system. By the way, to be more effective in coding, it is worth to
choose a source code editor with basic Ruby support (e.g.
syntax-highlighting, file browsing) or an integrated development
environment with advanced features (e.g. code completion, refactoring,
testing support).

Here is a list of popular tools used by Rubyists:

* Linux and cross-platform tools:
  * [Aptana Studio][19]
  * [Emacs][20] with [Ruby mode][21] and [Rsense][22]
  * [Geany][23]
  * [gedit][24]
  * [Vim][25] with [vim-ruby][26] plugin and [Rsense][22]
  * [RubyMine][27]
  * [SciTe][28]
  * [NetBeans][36]
  * [Sublime Text][37]
  * [Atom][atom]

* On Windows:
