  documents the standard library.

  GitHub-hosted Ruby projects.

### Editors and IDEs

For coding in Ruby, you can use the default editor of your operating
system. By the way, to be more effective in coding, it is worth choosing a source code editor with basic Ruby support (e.g.
syntax-highlighting, file browsing) or an integrated development
environment with advanced features (e.g. code completion, refactoring,
testing support).

Here is a list of popular tools used by Rubyists:
