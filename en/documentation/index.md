### Editors and IDEs

For coding in Ruby you can use the default editor of your operating
system. By the way, to be more effective in coding, it is worth to
choose a source code editor with basic Ruby support (e.g.
syntax-highlighting, file browsing) or an integrated development
environment with advanced features (e.g. code completion,refactoring,
testing support).

Here is a list of popular tools used by Rubyists:

* Linux and cross-platform tools:
