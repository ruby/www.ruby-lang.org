title: "To Ruby From C and C++"

It’s difficult to write a bulleted list describing how your code will be
different in Ruby from C or C++ because it’s quite a large difference.
One reason is that the Ruby runtime does so much for you. Ruby seems
about as far as you can get from C’s “no hidden mechanism” principle—the
whole point of Ruby is to make the human’s job easier at the expense of
making the runtime shoulder more of the work. Unless or until you
profile your code for optimization, you don’t need to care one whit
about “keeping your compiler happy” when using Ruby.

That said, for one thing, you can expect your Ruby code to execute much
more slowly than “equivalent” C or C++ code. At the same time, your head
will spin at how rapidly you can get a Ruby program up and running, as
well as at how few lines of code it will take to write it. Ruby is much
much simpler than C++—it will spoil you rotten.

Ruby is dynamically typed, rather than statically typed—the runtime does
as much as possible at run-time. For example, you don’t need to know
what modules your Ruby program will “link to” (that is, load and use) or
what methods it will call ahead of time.

Happily, it turns out that Ruby and C have a healthy symbiotic
relationship. Ruby supports so-called “extension modules”. These are
modules that you can use from your Ruby programs (and which, from the
outside, will look and act just like any other Ruby module), but which
are written in C. In this way, you can compartmentalize the
performance-critical parts of your Ruby software, and smelt those down
to pure C.

And, of course, Ruby itself is written in C.

### Similarities with C

As with C, in Ruby,...

* You may program procedurally if you like (but it will still be
  object-oriented behind the scenes).
* Most of the operators are the same (including the compound assignment
  and also bitwise operators). Though, Ruby doesn’t have `++` or `--`.
* You’ve got `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`.
* You can also have constants, though there’s no special `const`
  keyword. Const-ness is enforced by a naming convention instead— names
  starting with a capital letter are for constants.
* Strings go in double-quotes.
* Strings are mutable.
* Just like man pages, you can read most docs in your terminal
  window—though using the `ri` command.
* You’ve got the same sort of command-line debugger available.

### Similarities with C++

As with C++, in Ruby,...

* You’ve got mostly the same operators (even `::`). `<<` is often used
  for appending elements to a list. One note though: with Ruby you never
  use `->`—it’s always just `.`.
* `public`, `private`, and `protected` do similar jobs.
* Inheritance syntax is still only one character, but it’s `<` instead
  of `:`.
* You may put your code into “modules”, similar to how `namespace` in
  C++ is used.
* Exceptions work in a similar manner, though the keyword names have
  been changed to protect the innocent.

### Differences from C

Unlike C, in Ruby,...

* Objects are strongly typed (and variable names themselves have no type
  at all).
* There’s no macros or preprocessor. No casts. No pointers (nor pointer
  arithmetic). No typedefs, sizeof, nor enums.
* There are no header files. You just define your functions (usually
  referred to as “methods”) and classes in the main source code files.
* There’s no <tt>#define</tt>. Just use constants instead.
* As of Ruby 1.8, code is interpreted at run-time rather than compiled
  to any sort of machine- or byte-code.
* All variables live on the heap. Further, you don’t need to free them
  yourself—the garbage collector takes care of that.
* Arguments to methods (i.e. functions) are passed by reference, not by
  value.
* It’s `require 'foo'` instead of `#include <foo>` or `#include "foo"`.
* You cannot drop down to assembly.
* There’s no semicolons ending lines.
* You go without parentheses for `if` and `while` condition expressions.
* Parentheses for method (i.e. function) calls are often optional.
* You don’t usually use braces—just end multi-line constructs (like
  `while` loops) with an `end` keyword.
* The `do` keyword is for so-called “blocks”. There’s no “do statement”
  like in C.
* The term “block” means something different. It’s for a block of code
  that you associate with a method call so the method body can call out
  to the block while it executes.
* There are no variable declarations. You just assign to new names
  on-the-fly when you need them.
* When tested for truth, only `false` and `nil` evaluate to a false
  value. Everything else is true (including `0`, `0.0`, and `"0"`).
* There is no `char`—they are just 1-letter strings.
* Strings don’t end with a null byte.
* Array literals go in brackets instead of braces.
* Arrays just automatically get bigger when you stuff more elements into
  them.
* If you add two arrays, you get back a new and bigger array (of course,
  allocated on the heap) instead of doing pointer arithmetic.
* More often than not, everything is an expression (that is, things like
  `while` statements actually evaluate to an rvalue).

### Differences from C++

Unlike C++, in Ruby,...

* There’s no explicit references. That is, in Ruby, every variable is
  just an automatically dereferenced name for some object.
* Objects are strongly but *dynamically* typed. The runtime discovers
  *at runtime* if that method call actually works.
* The “constructor” is called `initialize` instead of the class name.
* All methods are always virtual.
* “Class” (static) variable names always begin with <tt>@@</tt> (as in
  <tt>@@total\_widgets</tt>).
* You don’t directly access member variables—all access to public member
  variables (known in Ruby as attributes) is via methods.
* It’s `self` instead of `this`.
* Some methods end in a ’?’ or a ’!’. It’s actually part of the method
  name.
* There’s no multiple inheritance per se. Though Ruby has “mixins” (i.e.
  you can “inherit” all instance methods of a module).
* There are some enforced case-conventions (ex. class names start with a
  capital letter, variables start with a lowercase letter).
* Parentheses for method calls are usually optional.
* You can re-open a class anytime and add more methods.
* There’s no need of C++ templates (since you can assign any kind of
  object to a given variable, and types get figured out at runtime
  anyway). No casting either.
* Iteration is done a bit differently. In Ruby, you don’t use a separate
  iterator object (like `vector<T>::const_iterator iter`) but instead
  your objects may mixin the `Enumerator` module and just make a method
  call like `my_obj.each`.
* There’s only two container types: `Array` and `Hash`.
* There’s no type conversions. With Ruby though, you’ll probably find
  that they aren’t necessary.
* Multithreading is built-in, but as of Ruby 1.8 they are “green
  threads” (implemented only within the interpreter) as opposed to
  native threads.
* A unit testing lib comes standard with Ruby.
