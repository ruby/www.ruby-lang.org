In [\[ruby-talk:88503\]][1], David Alan Black announced the launch of
the new official process for RCRs. The new process is the result of
matz’s desire to further formalize the process, as expressed in his
[RubyConf 2003][2] [presentation][3].

The new site for Ruby Change Requests is [rcrchive.net][4].

Many thanks to [Dave Thomas][5], who facilitated the creation of the RCR
process 3 years ago.
