In the programming community, user groups form support networks for
people interested in certain topics. They are a great place to increase
your skills and network with other programmers. User groups are informal
and their structure varies from group to group. Anyone can form their
own group and set their own rules and schedule.

### Ruby User Groups

If you want to get together with other Ruby programmers, a local user
group may be just the thing. Ruby user groups are entirely devoted to
Ruby. They typically feature monthly meetings, a mailing list, a website,
and if you're lucky, frequent hacking sessions (meetings devoted
to giving people a chance to write Ruby code).

Information about Ruby user groups can be found on various websites:

[rubyusersgroups.org][1]
: A public listing of Ruby groups throughout the world. Also allows
  Rubyists to place themselves on a map of the world.

[Ruby Meetup Groups][2]
: A substantial number of Ruby User Groups have chosen to make Meetup
  their home. Meetup provides a number of tools for user groups,
  including: private forums, a place for announcements, automated
  meeting reminders, and a nice RSVP system.

### Organizing Your Own Group

If you are interested in forming your own group, be sure to find out if
there is already a Ruby user group in your area. Larger meetings are
usually much more fun, so starting your own group may not be the best
option if there is already one nearby.
