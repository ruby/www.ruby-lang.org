The community that grows up around a programming language is one of its
most important strengths. Ruby has a vibrant and growing community that
is friendly towards people of all skill levels.

If you are interested in getting involved, here are a couple of places
to start:

[Ruby User Groups](user-groups/)
: Your local Ruby user group is a great place to network with other Ruby
  programmers. Ruby user groups are self-organizing and typically
  feature monthly meetings, a mailing list, a Web site, and if you are
  lucky, frequent codefests.

[Ruby Mailing Lists and Newsgroups](mailing-lists/)
: Ruby has an assortment of lists on different topics and in several
  languages. If you have questions about Ruby, asking them on a mailing
  list is a great way to get answers.

[Ruby on IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/ruby-lang)
: The Ruby Language IRC Channel is a wonderful way to chat with fellow
  Rubyists. ([Previous Chat Logs][1])

[Ruby Core](ruby-core/)
: Now is a fantastic time to follow Ruby’s development.
  If you are interested in helping with Ruby, start here.

[Weblogs About Ruby](weblogs/)
: Very little happens in the Ruby community that is not talked about on
  the blogs. We’ve got a nice list of suggestions for you here for
  getting plugged in.

[Ruby Conferences](conferences/)
: Ruby programmers around the world are getting involved in more and
  more conferences, where they get together to share reports on
  work-in-progress, discuss the future of Ruby, and welcome newcomers to
  the Ruby community.

[The Ruby Mentor Project][2]
: This new resource aims to pair people new to Ruby with more
  experienced guides. The goal is to ease the process of learning Ruby
  by having someone you can ask questions from. This is intended to be a
  little less intimidating than a mailing list, though Ruby Talk does
  welcome questions from beginners.
