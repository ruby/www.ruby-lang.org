There is an unsafe object creation vulnerability in the json gem bundled with Ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2020-10663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10663). We strongly recommend upgrading the json gem.

## Details

When parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one bundled with Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the target system.

This is the same issue as [CVE-2013-0269](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/).  The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed `JSON.parse(user_input)`, but didn't address some other styles of JSON parsing including `JSON(user_input)` and `JSON.parse(user_input, nil)`.

See [CVE-2013-0269](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/) in detail.  Note that the issue was exploitable to cause a Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable Symbol objects, but this kind of attack is no longer valid because Symbol objects are now garbage-collectable.  However, creating arbitrary objects may cause severe security consequences depending upon the application code.

Please update the json gem to version 2.3.0 or later.  You can use `gem update json` to update it.  If you are using bundler, please add `gem "json", ">= 2.3.0"` to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* JSON gem 2.2.0 or prior
