A NUL injection vulnerability of Ruby built-in methods (`File.fnmatch` and `File.fnmatch?`) was found.  An attacker who has the control of the path pattern parameter could exploit this vulnerability to make path matching pass despite the intention of the program author.
[CVE-2019-15845](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15845) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

## Details

Built-in methods `File.fnmatch` and its alias `File.fnmatch?` accept the path pattern as their first parameter.  When the pattern contains NUL character (`\0`), the methods recognize that the path pattern ends immediately before the NUL byte.  Therefore, a script that uses an external input as the pattern argument, an attacker can make it wrongly match a pathname that is the second parameter.

All users running any affected releases should upgrade as soon as possible.
