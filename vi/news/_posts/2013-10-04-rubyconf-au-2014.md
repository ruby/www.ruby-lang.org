[RubyConf Australia 2014][1] will be held in Sydney on February 19 to 21.
It will be the second Ruby conference held in Australia.

The Call For Proposals is open until October 31. Proposals will be
by GitHub pull request, like EuRuKo and Sapporo RubyKaigi.

"Egg" (pre early-bird) tickets are available until October 28.
Scholarships to attend the event are also available.

Our first conference had many speakers from overseas, but also local speakers
you may not have seen before. The topics were very diverse and the talks were
enlightening. We also had a variety of workshops, and afterwards people
socialized and explored the city it was hosted in.

You can get additional information by following us on twitter at

on Vimeo.

We hope to see you there!
