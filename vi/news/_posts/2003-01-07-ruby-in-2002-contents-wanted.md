Here on the Ruby Garden Wiki comes [a page][1] to compile Ruby’s year
2002 and plans on 2003. The deadline is January 9. RubyIn2002
[http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyIn2002][1] This page supports a
following plan: “The Year in Scripting
Languages(Lua/Perl/Python/Ruby/Tcl)”. The aim of that is to encourage
these scripting language communities to collaborate with each other; its
first step is to know neighbors, which will lead us to be able to share
our efforts on scriptings. The chair person is Mitchell N. Charity. see
also: [\[ruby-talk:60604\]][2], [\[ruby-talk:60731\]][3] Final result
can be seen at [http://www.vendian.org/language\_year/][4].
