We announce that all support of the Ruby 2.2 series has ended.

After the release of Ruby 2.2.7 on March 28, 2017,
the support of the Ruby 2.2 series was in the security maintenance phase.
Now, after one year has passed, this phase has ended.
Therefore, on March 31, 2018, all support of the Ruby 2.2 series has ended.
Bug and security fixes from more recent Ruby versions will no longer be
backported to 2.2, and no further patch release of 2.2 will be released.
We highly recommend that you upgrade to Ruby 2.5 or 2.4 as soon as possible.

And, if a critical security issue is found, we will release an urgent fix
for it.

We will never backport any bug fixes to 2.3 except security fixes.
