There is a vulnerability in DL and Fiddle in Ruby where tainted strings can be
used by system calls regardless of the $SAFE level set in Ruby. This
vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-2065.

## Impact

Native functions exposed to Ruby with DL or Fiddle do not check the taint
values set on the objects passed in.  This can result in tainted objects being
accepted as input when a SecurityError exception should be raised.

Impacted DL code will look something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_function(user_input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys_cfunc = DL::CFunc.new(handle['system'], DL::TYPE_INT, 'system')
  sys       = DL::Function.new(sys_cfunc, [DL::TYPE_VOIDP])
  sys.call user_input
end

$SAFE = 1
my_function "uname -rs".taint
{% endhighlight %}

Impacted Fiddle code will look something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_function(user_input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys = Fiddle::Function.new(handle['system'],
                             [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP], Fiddle::TYPE_INT)
  sys.call user_input
end

$SAFE = 1
my_function "uname -rs".taint
{% endhighlight %}

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

Note that this *does not* prevent numeric memory offsets from being used as
pointer values.  Numbers cannot be tainted, so code passing a numeric memory
offset cannot be checked.  For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_function(input)
  handle    = DL.dlopen(nil)
  sys = Fiddle::Function.new(handle['system'],
                             [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP], Fiddle::TYPE_INT)
  sys.call input
end

$SAFE = 1
user_input = "uname -rs".taint
my_function DL::CPtr[user_input].to_i
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, the memory location is passed, and taintedness of the object
cannot be determined by DL / Fiddle.  In this case, please check the tainting
of the user input before passing the memory location:

{% highlight ruby %}
user_input = "uname -rs".taint
raise if $SAFE >= 1 && user_input.tainted?
my_function DL::CPtr[user_input].to_i
{% endhighlight %}

## Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade Ruby, this monkey patch can be used as a workaround:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Fiddle::Function
  alias :old_call :call
  def call(*args)
    if $SAFE >= 1 && args.any? { |x| x.tainted? }
      raise SecurityError, "tainted parameter not allowed"
    end
    old_call(*args)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
