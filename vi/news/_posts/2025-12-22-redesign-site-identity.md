We are excited to announce a comprehensive redesign of our site. The design for this update was created by [Taeko Akatsuka](https://x.com/ken_c_lo).

As part of this update, we have redesigned the site's identity as "A language where people gather, a site where people are visible."

Ruby has been a language centered on "programmer happiness" for 30 years. The new key visual expresses the presence of people surrounding Ruby.

The composition features diverse hand-drawn illustrated characters radiating outward from the central Ruby logo, representing developers around the world connecting through Ruby, creating value in their respective fields, and enjoying Ruby alongside familiar motifs.

While conveying Ruby's modern strengths of ecosystem, productivity, and community, the warm visual style embodies the unchanged joy, approachability, and tactile quality that have been core to Ruby since its inception. We aimed for an expression unique to Ruby that cannot be found on other programming language sites.

Matz highlights simplicity of expression as one of Ruby's strengths, in addition to ecosystem, productivity, and community. In the new design, following the key visual, Ruby code is displayed to emphasize its essence as a programming language.

We also incorporated interviews with community members and photographs, creating a site where you can sense the presence of the many people behind the programming language.

The site-wide update with the new design is still ongoing. There are still many areas for improvement, such as broken links and inconsistencies. We look forward to your feedback.
