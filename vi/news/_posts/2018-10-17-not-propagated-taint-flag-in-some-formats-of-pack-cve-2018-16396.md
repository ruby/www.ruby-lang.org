In `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` with some formats, the tainted flags
of the original data are not propagated to the returned string/array.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
[CVE-2018-16396](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16396).

## Details

The `Array#pack` method converts the receiver's contents into a string with
a specified format.  If the receiver contains some tainted objects, the
returned string also should be tainted.  The `String#unpack` method which
converts the receiver into an array also should propagate its tainted
flag to the objects contained in the returned array.
But, with the `B`, `b`, `H`, and `h` directives, the tainted flags are not
propagated.  So, if a script processes unreliable inputs by `Array#pack`
and/or `String#unpack` with these directives and checks the reliability
with tainted flags, the check might be wrong.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
