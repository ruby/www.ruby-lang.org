Even though it’s last minute, if you are Ruby Rock Star, you have a
chance to win a 1,000,000 Japanese Yen (approximately 12,000 U.S.
dollars!). The Government of Fukuoka Japan (the Fukuoka Ruby Business
Hub Promotion Committee) is hosting the Fukuoka Ruby Award 2011
Competition. Not only the big prize, but also the inventor and creator
of Ruby, Matz will be testing and reviewing your source code thoroughly.
So it’s very meaningful to apply. The official deadline is November
15th, but they will accept the late entries from the U.S. specially up
until the end of this month(11/30). There aren’t many applicants at this
point (less than 10). Which means you have a very high chance to win the
prize! So, hurry up! It’s Free to enter! Please see [this page][1] for
more details.
