There is an unsafe tainted string usage vulnerability in Fiddle and DL.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
[CVE-2015-7551](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7551).

## Details

There is an unsafe tainted string vulnerability in Fiddle and DL.
This issue was originally reported and fixed with [CVE-2009-5147](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5147) in DL,
but reappeared after DL was reimplemented using Fiddle and libffi.

And, about DL, [CVE-2009-5147](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5147) was fixed at Ruby 1.9.1,
but not fixed at other branches, then rubies which bundled DL
except Ruby 1.9.1 are still vulnerable.

Impacted code looks something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
handle = Fiddle::Handle.new(dangerous_user_input)
{% endhighlight %}

Or:

{% highlight ruby %}
handle = Fiddle::Handle.new(some_library)
function_pointer = handle[dangerous_user_input]
{% endhighlight %}

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
the workarounds immediately.

## Affected Versions

* All patch releases of Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 1.9.3 (DL and Fiddle).
* All patch releases of Ruby 2.0.0 prior to Ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 648 (DL and Fiddle).
* All versions of Ruby 2.1 prior to Ruby 2.1.8 (DL and Fiddle).
* All versions of Ruby 2.2 prior to Ruby 2.2.4 (Fiddle).
* Ruby 2.3.0 preview 1 and preview 2 (Fiddle).
* prior to trunk revision 53153 (Fiddle).

## Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade, the following monkey patch can be applied as a
workaround for Fiddle:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Fiddle::Handle
  alias :old_initialize :initialize

  def initialize file, *args
    raise SecurityError if file.tainted? && $SAFE > 0
    old_initialize file, *args
  end

  alias :sym :[]
  alias :old_call :[]

  def [] fun
    raise SecurityError if fun.tainted? && $SAFE > 0
    old_call fun
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using DL, use Fiddle instead of it.
