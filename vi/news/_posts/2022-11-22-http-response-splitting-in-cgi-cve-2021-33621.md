We have released the cgi gem version 0.3.5, 0.2.2, and 0.1.0.2 that has a security fix for a HTTP response splitting vulnerability.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2021-33621](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33621).

## Details

If an application that generates HTTP responses using the cgi gem with untrusted user input, an attacker can exploit it to inject a malicious HTTP response header and/or body.

Also, the contents for a `CGI::Cookie` object were not checked properly. If an application creates a `CGI::Cookie` object based on user input, an attacker may exploit it to inject invalid attributes in `Set-Cookie` header. We think such applications are unlikely, but we have included a change to check arguments for `CGI::Cookie#initialize` preventatively.

Please update the cgi gem to version 0.3.5, 0.2.2, and 0.1.0.2, or later. You can use `gem update cgi` to update it.
If you are using bundler, please add `gem "cgi", ">= 0.3.5"` to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* cgi gem 0.3.3 or before
* cgi gem 0.2.1 or before
* cgi gem 0.1.1 or 0.1.0.1 or 0.1.0
