There is an unintentional directory traversal in some methods in `Dir`.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-8780](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8780).

## Details

`Dir.open`, `Dir.new`, `Dir.entries` and `Dir.empty?` accept the path of the target directory as their parameter.
If the parameter contains NUL (`\0`) bytes, these methods recognize that the path is completed before the NUL bytes.
So, if a script accepts an external input as the argument of these methods, the attacker can make the unintentional directory traversal.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

## Affected Versions

* Ruby 2.2 series: 2.2.9 and earlier
* Ruby 2.3 series: 2.3.6 and earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: 2.4.3 and earlier
* Ruby 2.5 series: 2.5.0 and earlier
* Ruby 2.6 series: 2.6.0-preview1
* prior to trunk revision r62989
