There is an overflow in URI escape parsing of YAML in Ruby.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
[CVE-2014-2525](http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-003.html).

## Details

Any time a string in YAML with tags is parsed, a specially crafted string can cause
a heap overflow which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
YAML.load <code_from_unknown_source>
{% endhighlight %}

## Affected Versions

Ruby 1.9.3-p0 and above include psych as the default YAML parser.
Any versions of psych linked against libyaml `<= 0.1.5` are affected.

And, these versions of Ruby bundle an affected version of libyaml:

* Ruby 2.0.0-p451 and earlier,
* Ruby 2.1.0 and Ruby 2.1.1.

You can verify the version of libyaml used by running:

{% highlight sh %}
$ ruby -rpsych -e 'p Psych.libyaml_version'
[0, 1, 5]
{% endhighlight %}

## Solutions

Users who install libyaml to the system are recommended to update libyaml to `0.1.6`.
When recompiling Ruby, point to the newly updated libyaml:

{% highlight sh %}
$ ./configure --with-yaml-dir=/path/to/libyaml
{% endhighlight %}

Users without a system libyaml rely on the embedded libyaml and are recommended
to update psych to `2.0.5` which vendors libyaml `0.1.6`:

{% highlight sh %}
$ gem install psych
{% endhighlight %}

or, update your Ruby to 2.0.0-p481, 2.1.2 or newer.
