With people traveling from all over the world, [by train][1], by car,
and by air, enthusiasm is building for [RubyConf 2006][2]! The
conference is scheduled to begin Friday morning, but if you arrive early
you may be able to join in on a few preliminary activities.

There are over [16 talks scheduled][3] with topics ranging from
*Leveraging Mac OS X from Ruby* to *YARV on Rails*. There’s even a talk
on *Natural Language Processing in Ruby* and one on the development of
Iron Mongrel (the hot new Web server written in Ruby). Check out the
[talk descriptions][4] for the gory details.

Also, if you are planning to attend the conference, be sure to put a bio
up on the [RubyConf 2006 Facebook][5]. If you are blogging or posting
photos about the conference, tag your content with “rubyconf” (one word)
and “rubyconf2006” (also one word). This will make it easy for people to
find your stuff on [Technorati][6] and [Flickr][7].
