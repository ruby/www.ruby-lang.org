Hello, and thank you for your getting into our community.

I know most of you more or less use version 1.8.7 of Ruby today. It was
released in 2008 and was a state-of-art Ruby release back then. -- I am
proud to say it is no longer. Ruby\'s core developers have been actively
working on their new version, 1.9, and they are about to release new
1.9.3. I have been using 1.9 for years and now I cannot go back to the
days without it. Rich features. Faster execution. Rubygems integrated.
Rails works perfectly. I cannot but say it is totally wonderful.
Everyone please, use 1.9.

But at the same time I know you cannot switch to 1.9 right now for
various reasons. Maybe you have already deployed your application with
1.8.7. Maybe you use a 3rd party library and that is for 1.8.7 only. Or
maybe your Linux distribution only supports 1.8.7. So I hereby announce
you how long you can stick to it. It is OK if you are using 1.8.7 today
but after a while, it will be shut down.

Please be ready.

Schedule:

* We continue to provide normal maintenance for 1.8.7 as usual, until
  June 2012. You can safely assume we provide bugfixes and no
  incompatibility shall be introduced.

* After that we stop bugfixes. We still provide security fixes until
  June 2013, in case you are still using 1.8.7.

* We will no longer support 1.8.7 in all senses after June 2013.
