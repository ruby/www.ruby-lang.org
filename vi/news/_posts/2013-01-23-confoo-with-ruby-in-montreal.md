If you have never heard of ConFoo, it is one of the most important
developer-oriented conferences. The team brings 100 speakers from around
the globe to share their hands-on experience with various web
technologies. The best news is: it’s driven by the community and is non
profit!

1h presentations cover: Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Python, .NET, Java,
e-Commerce, Security, Mobile, UX and other topics. [The schedule][1] is
quite impressive.

They also have hands-on training and a hackaton in the two days before
the main event.
