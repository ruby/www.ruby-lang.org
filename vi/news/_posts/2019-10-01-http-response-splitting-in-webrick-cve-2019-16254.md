There is an HTTP response splitting vulnerability in WEBrick bundled with Ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2019-16254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16254).

## Details

If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.

This is the same issue as [CVE-2017-17742](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/03/28/http-response-splitting-in-webrick-cve-2017-17742/).  The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

## Affected Versions

* All releases that are Ruby 2.3 or earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: Ruby 2.4.7 or earlier
* Ruby 2.5 series: Ruby 2.5.6 or earlier
* Ruby 2.6 series: Ruby 2.6.4 or earlier
* Ruby 2.7.0-preview1
* prior to master commit 3ce238b5f9795581eb84114dcfbdf4aa086bfecc
