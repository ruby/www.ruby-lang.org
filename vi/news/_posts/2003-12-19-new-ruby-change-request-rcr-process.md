In [\[ruby-talk:88503\]][1], David Alan Black announced the launch of
the new official process for RCRs. The new process is the result of
matzâ€™s desire to further formalize the process, as expressed in his
[RubyConf 2003][2] [presentation][3].

The new site for Ruby Change Requests is [rcrchive.net][4].

Many thanks to [Dave Thomas][5], who facilitated the creation of the RCR
process 3 years ago.
