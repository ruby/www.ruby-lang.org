There is a denial of service and unsafe object creation vulnerability in
the json bundled with ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2013-0269. We strongly recommend to upgrade ruby.

## Details

When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem (includes bundled with
ruby) can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system.
Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a
denial of service attack.

The same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that
act like internal objects. These \"act alike\" objects can be used to
bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for
SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.

Impacted code looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
JSON.parse(user_input)
{% endhighlight %}

Where the \`user\_input\` variable will have a JSON document like this:

    {"json_class":"foo"}

The JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant \"foo\". Looking up
this constant will create a symbol.

In JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created
using JSON documents like this:

    {"json_class":"JSON::GenericObject","foo":"bar"}

This document will result in an instance of JSON::GenericObject, with
the attribute \"foo\" that has the value \"bar\". Instantiating these
objects will result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can
be used to bypass security measures.

PLEASE NOTE: this behavior **does not change** when using \`JSON.load\`.
\`JSON.load\` should **never** be given input from unknown sources. If
you are processing JSON from an unknown source, **always** use
\`JSON.parse\`.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
of the workarounds immediately.

## Workarounds

For users that cannot upgrade ruby or JSON gem, change your code from
this:

{% highlight ruby %}
JSON.parse(json)
{% endhighlight %}

To this:

{% highlight ruby %}
JSON.parse(json, :create_additions => false)
{% endhighlight %}

If you cannot change the usage of \`JSON.parse\` (for example you\'re
using a gem which depends on \`JSON.parse\` like multi\_json), then
apply this monkey patch:

{% highlight ruby %}
module JSON
  class << self
    alias :old_parse :parse
    def parse(json, args = {})
      args[:create_additions] = false
      old_parse(json, args)
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Affected versions

* All ruby 1.9 versions prior to ruby 1.9.3 patchlevel 392
* All ruby 2.0 versions prior to ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 0
* prior to trunk revision 39208
