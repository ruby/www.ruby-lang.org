A vulnerability was found that file creation routines can create
unintended files by strategically inserting NUL(s) in file paths. This
vulnerability has been reported as CVE-2012-4522.

## Details

Ruby can handle arbitrary binary patterns as Strings, including NUL
chars. On the other hand OSes and other libraries tend not. They usually
treat a NUL as an End of String mark. So to interface them with Ruby,
NUL chars should properly be avoided.

However methods like IO#open did not check the filename passed to them,
and just passed those strings to lower layer routines. This led to
create unintentional files like this:

    p File.exists?("foo")      #=> false
    open("foo\0bar", "w") { |f| f.puts "hai" }
    p File.exists?("foo")      #=> true
    p File.exists?("foo\0bar") #=> raises ArgumentError

## Affected versions

* All Ruby 1.9.3 prior to patchlevel 286
* All development branches of Ruby 2.0.0 prior to revision r37163
