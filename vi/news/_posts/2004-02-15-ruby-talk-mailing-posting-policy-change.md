The ruby-talk mailing has changed its posting policy. The list now
requires one to be a member before posting a message. This is a change
from the previous “anyone may post” policy. If you’ve sent some recent
list messages, but have not seen them on the list, check if you’re using
an appropriate “from” address, and look for any automated list admin
messages coming back.
