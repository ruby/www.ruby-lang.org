Now Ruby 1.9.3-p429 is released.
We once released p426 some hours before, but it had build problems on some platforms.
Use this p429 instead, please.

This release includes a security fix about bundled DL / Fiddle.

* [Object taint bypassing in DL and Fiddle in Ruby (CVE-2013-2065)](/en/news/2013/05/14/taint-bypass-dl-fiddle-cve-2013-2065/)

And some small bugfixes are also included.

See [tickets](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-193/issues?set_filter=1&amp;status_id=5) and [ChangeLog](https://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_9_3_429/ChangeLog) for details.
