I wanted to get the word out about the upcoming Tulsa Ruby Workshop.
This will take place on April 26th, from 10 AM to 4 PM in Tulsa, OK.

The workshop has a great line up of intro Ruby and Rail content. I’m
honored to have been asked to give two of the talks that day: an
introduction to Ruby talk as well as a Ruby from Java talk. There will
also be a beginning Rails talk from Tulsa.rb’s commander and chief, an
Engine Yard employee on hand sharing deployment advice, as well as other
language specific migration talks.

That’s pretty much a full day of Ruby learning and the best news is that
attendance is free. They are even throwing in some food.

If you’re going to be in the area, definitely come join us!

You can find directions, a schedule, and other details about the

Hope to see you there.
