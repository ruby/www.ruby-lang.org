Continuing in Google’s great tradition of encouraging student open
source development, [Ruby Central][1], [Engine Yard][2], and the [Rails
core team][3] are teaming up to present the first annual [Ruby Summer of
Code][4].

Head over to [rubysoc.org][4] to get started and follow [@rubysoc][5]
for news.

The summer will follow Google’s example closely:

* students are paid a $5000 stipend to work full-time during their
  summer break
* a group of Ruby gurus volunteer their time as mentors
* mentors vote on student proposals based on usefulness, benefit to the
  Ruby community, and history of motivated open source contribution

The more we raise, the more students we can fund. [Donate now!][4]
