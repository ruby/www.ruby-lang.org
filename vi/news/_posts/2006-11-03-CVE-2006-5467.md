A vulnerability has been discovered in the CGI library (cgi.rb) that
ships with Ruby which could be used by a malicious user to create a
denial of service attack (DoS). The problem is triggered by sending the
library an HTTP request that uses multipart MIME encoding and has an
invalid boundary specifier that begins with “-” instead of “--”. Once
triggered it will exhaust all available memory resources effectively
creating a DoS condition.

**Ruby 1.8.5 and all prior versions are vulnerable.** This vulnerability
is open to the public as [CVE-2006-5467][1].

### Vulnerable Versions

1.8 series
: 1\.8.5 and all prior versions

Development version (1.9 series)
: All versions before 2006-09-23

### Solution

1.8 series
: Please apply the patch after you update to Ruby 1.8.5:

  * [CGI DoS Patch][2] (367 bytes; md5sum:
    9d25f59d1c33a0b215f6c25260dcb536)
