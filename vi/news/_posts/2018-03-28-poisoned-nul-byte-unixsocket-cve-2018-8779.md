There is a unintentional socket creation vulnerability in `UNIXServer.open` method of socket library bundled with Ruby.
And there is also a unintentional socket access vulnerability in `UNIXSocket.open` method.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-8779](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8779).

## Details

`UNIXServer.open` accepts the path of the socket to be created at the first parameter.
If the path contains NUL (`\0`) bytes, this method recognize that the path is completed before the NUL bytes.
So, if a script accepts an external input as the argument of this method, the attacker can make the socket file in the unintentional path.
And, `UNIXSocket.open` also accepts the path of the socket to be created at the first parameter without checking NUL bytes like `UNIXServer.open`.
So, if a script accepts an external input as the argument of this method, the attacker can accepts the socket file in the unintentional path.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
