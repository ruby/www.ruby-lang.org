Has anyone helped you greatly in the Ruby community this past year? Maybe they
taught you something, wrote a gem, or gave you some tech support? If anyone
comes to mind, then please take the time to
[nominate them](http://rubyheroes.com/) for a Ruby Hero Award.

In the past 6 years I've given away 38 trophies to those in our community who
don't get the recognition they deserve. In three weeks, the Ruby Heroes from
all previous years will look at the nominations and decide who should receive
the awards (this way there’s no popularity contest). However, your nominations
do matter, so please take a moment and spread the gratitude.
