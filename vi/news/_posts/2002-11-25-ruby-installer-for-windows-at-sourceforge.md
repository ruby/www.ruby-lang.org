Now you can get Ruby Installer For Windows from
[http://rubyinstaller.sourceforge.net/][1].

Excerpted from the site.


    This is a "one-click", self-contained installer that
    comprises the Ruby language itself, dozens of popular
    extensions and packages, a syntax-highlighting editor
    and execution environment, and a Windows help file that
    contains the full text of the book, "Programming Ruby:
    The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide". 

It’s a must item for Ruby users on Win32 box. Check also
[eban/ruby/binaries/”&gt;eban’s win32 binaries][2]{: http:=""} to get
Win32 binaries with dozens of popular extensions.
