Scotland on Rails is pleased to announce that Conference2008 is open for
registration. There is a limit to the number of registrations we’re able
to accept so we’d advise you to get in quickly :-)

You can register at [http://scotlandonrails.com/register][1] The
conference will take place on April 4th and 5th in Edinburgh (in a
castle!), Scotland and will feature speakers from the UK, Europe, US and
New Zealand including keynotes from Michael Koziarski and David Black. A
list of sessions and speakers is available at
[http://scotlandonrails.com/talks][2].

We’re also planning a charity event on Thursday 3rd. This will feature
an beginner level intro to Ruby and Rails in the morning, and sessions
from several of the speakers from the main conference (including Jim
Weirich, Bruce Williams and Giles Bowkett) in the afternoon. All the
money raised from that days event will be going to CHAS – The Childrens
Hospice Association.
