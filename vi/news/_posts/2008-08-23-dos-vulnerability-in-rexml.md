There is a DoS vulnerability in the REXML library included in the Ruby
Standard Library. A so-called \"XML entity explosion\" attack technique
can be used for remotely bringing down (disabling) any application which
parses user-provided XML using REXML.

Most Rails applications will be vulnerable because Rails parses
user-provided XML using REXML by default.

## Impact

An attacker can cause a denial of service by causing REXML to parse a
document containing recursively nested entities such as:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE member [
      <!ENTITY a "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;">
      <!ENTITY b "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;">
      <!ENTITY c "&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;">
      <!ENTITY d "&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;">
      <!ENTITY e "&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;">
      <!ENTITY f "&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;">
      <!ENTITY g "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx">
    ]>
    <member>
    &a;
    </member>

## Vulnerable versions

### 1.8 series

* 1\.8.6-p287 and all prior versions
* 1\.8.7-p72 and all prior versions

### 1.9 series

* all versions

## Solution

Please download the following monkey patch to fix this problem.

* [&lt;URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/security/20080823rexml/rexml-expansion-fix2.rb&gt;][1]

Then fix your application to load rexml-expansion-fix2.rb before using
REXML.

    require "rexml-expansion-fix2"
    ...
    doc = REXML::Document.new(str)
    ...

If you have a Rails application, copy rexml-expansion-fix2.rb into a
directory on the load path (such as RAILS\_ROOT/lib/), and put the
following line into config/environment.rb.

    require "rexml-expansion-fix2"

If your application is Rails 2.1 or later, you can simply copy
rexml-expansion-fix2.rb to RAILS\_ROOT/config/initializers and it will
be required automatically.

By default, XML entity expansion limit is 10000. You can change it by
changing REXML::Document.entity\_expansion\_limit. e.g.

    REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 1000

This fix will be made available as a gem and used by future versions of
rails, but users should take corrective action immediately.
