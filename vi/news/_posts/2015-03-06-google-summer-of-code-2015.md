Ruby will be participating in the [Google Summer of Code 2015][gsoc] as a top-level organization. We will be acting as an
umbrella for Ruby-related projects including [Ruby][ruby-ideas], [JRuby][jruby-ideas], [Celluloid][celluloid] and
[others][ideas]. Student applications can be submitted starting March 16 and the deadline is March 27
(here's the [timeline][timeline]).

If you are interested in participating as a student or as a mentor please join our
[mailing list][ml]. You can find a list of ideas for projects in the [RubyGSoC wiki][ideas].

[Ruby on Rails][ror] and [SciRuby][sciruby] will also be joining us as top-level
organizations in this year's program. If you have an idea that would fit better in these projects, please read their
[respective][ror-announcement] [announcements][sciruby-ideas].
