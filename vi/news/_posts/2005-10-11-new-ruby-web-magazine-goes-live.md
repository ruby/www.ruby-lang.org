The newest on-line resource for serious Ruby information has gone live.
[Ruby Code &amp; Style][1], an on-line magazine from [Artima][2], has
just published issue #1. Check out the names on the advisory board. It’s
a Who’s Who of everybody who’s anybody in the Ruby world. The premiere
issue has three outstanding articles: First up, Jack Herrington, author
of Code Generation in Action (Manning, 2002) and Podcasting Hacks
(O’Reilly, 2005), has written [Modular Architectures with Ruby][3] Next,
Austin Ziegler gives us [Creating Printable Documents with Ruby][4] And
there’s a reprint of Ara Howard’s article, [Linux Clustering with Ruby
Queue: Small is Beautiful][5], which first appeared in Linux Journal but
deserves repeat attention A big thanks to the advisory board, and
especial to Bill Venners for starting this whole thing.
