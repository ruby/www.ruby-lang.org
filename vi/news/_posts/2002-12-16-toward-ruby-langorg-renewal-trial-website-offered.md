We webmasters’ team of ruby-lang.org have reformed our official site
design, so that we can provide natural contents navigation and
just-in-time information about Ruby.

Now we can offer a trial for a future official site. Here we are:

> [http://dev.ruby-lang.org/en/][1]

And here is Japanese site:

> [http://dev.ruby-lang.org/ja/][2]

Have a go and look at it.

Our scheme is a double release with ruby 1.6.8; the switchover of the
site will be in the end of this year, if no critical problems are found.
If you find them, feel free to tell us via this list, or mail directly
to the address below.

Cheers,

—ruby-lang.org webmaster team
