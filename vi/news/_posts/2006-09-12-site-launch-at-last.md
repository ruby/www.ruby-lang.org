As you can see the much anticipated redesign is now live. It was over a
year ago that [it was suggested][1] that a “visual identity team” be
formed for the purpose of redesigning the Ruby Web site. The redesign
team created over 20 mockups for the the new site, [posted several][2]
for the Ruby community to comment on, and finally decided on the current
design.

Once the design was chosen it was lovingly converted to CSS and XHTML
and an [administration system][3] was written for it. The content was
then ported over from the old Web site and massaged by an enthusiastic
group of volunteers.

The Ruby Visual Identity Team is composed of:

* Ben Giddings
* James Edward Gray II
* Curt Hibbs
* John Long
* Shugo Maeda
* Michel Martens
* Why the Lucky Stiff

The following people also contributed expertise or content to the new
Web site:

* David Alan Black
* Alex Combas
* Damphyr
* Eric Davis
* Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto
* Matt Todd
* Usaku Nakamura
* A handful of Japanese volunteers (who did the [translation](/ja/))

It would be great if we could list the names of all the people who gave
suggestions, reported bugs, or contributed in some way, but the list
would grow very long indeed. This site is truly a product of the Ruby
community and we want to thank everyone who made it happen. Kudos to
each and every one of you!

If you have comments or questions about the redesign, you are cordially
invited to join the discussion over on the [VIT-Discuss mailing
list][4].
