A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was found on the BigDecimal
standard library of Ruby. Conversion from BigDecimal objects into Float
numbers had a problem which enables attackers to effectively cause
segmentation faults.

ActiveRecord relies on this method, so most Rails applications are
affected by this. Though this is not a Rails-specific issue.

## Impact

An attacker can cause a denial of service by causing BigDecimal to parse
an insanely large number, such as:


    BigDecimal("9E69999999").to_s("F")
