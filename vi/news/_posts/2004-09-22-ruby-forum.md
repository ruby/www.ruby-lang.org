A link to [Ruby Forum][1] was added to [Community](/en/community/)
Alexey Verkhovsky saids, \`Ruby Forum is a newly created bulletin board
for discussing Ruby. Unlike ruby-talk mailing list, it allows anonymous
posting and implements more understandable interface for searching.
Intended target audience of this forum is newcomers to Ruby that are not
committed enough to subscribe to a 100+ posts/day mailing list.â€™
