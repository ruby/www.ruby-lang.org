There is a command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP bundled with Ruby.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
[CVE-2017-17405](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17405).

## Details

`Net::FTP#get`, `getbinaryfile`, `gettextfile`, `put`, `putbinaryfile`, and
`puttextfile` use `Kernel#open` to open a local file.  If the `localfile`
argument starts with the pipe character `"|"`, the command following the
pipe character is executed.  The default value of `localfile` is
`File.basename(remotefile)`, so malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary
command execution.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

## Affected Versions

* Ruby 2.2 series: 2.2.8 and earlier
* Ruby 2.3 series: 2.3.5 and earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: 2.4.2 and earlier
* Ruby 2.5 series: 2.5.0-preview1
* prior to trunk revision r61242
