![ConFoo Web Techno Conference. February 25 - March  1, 2013 | Montreal, Canada](http://confoo.ca/images/propaganda/2013/en/t-ruby.jpg){: style="border:0; float:right" width="180" height="250"}ConFoo is one of the most important developer-oriented conferences and
includes Ruby content. ConFoo 2013 will be held on February 25 through
March 1 in Montreal, Canada.

The team just opened its call for papers. Candidates can submit
proposals **until September 23**. Consult the [call for papers][1] page
for details and to start submitting. That page also explains what
expenses ConFoo can cover for speakers. You can even get [advice][2] on
how to write proposals.

The call for papers is public, meaning that all proposals get published
on the website for others to vote and comment on. This approach allows
the organizers to pick subjects that have most interest in the
community. The comments are only visible to speakers and organizers to
avoid influencing the votes.

To stay in touch via Twitter, follow [@confooca][3] and use the
[#confoo][4] tag. You can also help promote the event with these cool
[badges][5] for your site.
