WEBrick, a standard library of Ruby to implement HTTP servers, has file
access vulnerability.

## Impact

The following programs are vulnerable.

1.  Programs that publish files using `WEBrick::HTTPServer.new` with the
    `:DocumentRoot` option
2.  Programs that publish files using
    `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::FileHandler`

Affected systems are:

1.  Systems that accept backslash (\\) as a path separator, such as
    Windows.
2.  Systems that use case insensitive filesystems such as NTFS on
    Windows, HFS on Mac OS X.

This vulnerability has the following impacts.

1.  Attacker can access private files by sending a url with url encoded
    backslash (\\). This exploit works only on systems that accept
    backslash as a path separator.

    Example:

        http://[server]:[port]/..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c/boot.ini

2.  Attacker can access files that matches to the patterns specified by
    the `:NondisclosureName` option (the default value is `[".ht*",
    "*~"]`). This exploit works only on systems that use case
    insensitive filesystems.
