David Black [announced][1] on ruby-talk that there are now 136
registrants, from 12 countries, for RubyConf 2005. If you still have not
registered, do it now. Full registration (i.e., full meal plans) ends in
two weeks. Non-full may continue past that, but not forever. Go to the
[RubyConf][2] site for complete registration details.
