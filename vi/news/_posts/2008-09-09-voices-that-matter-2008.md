Pearson Education is running a [Voices That Matter][1] Ruby conference
this fall in Boston. The conference, from the same people who
Addison-Wesley\'s Professional Ruby Series, will give you a chance to
meet and learn from those very same authors. Don\'t miss a chance to
interact with so many Ruby professionals.
