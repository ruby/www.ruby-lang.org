The [Ruby Hero Awards][1] are now accepting nominations and we need your
help to find people in our community who thanklessly help others and
perhaps don’t get the recognition they deserve. This could be someone
who contributes to ruby open source software you’ve found useful in the
past year, could be an educator, or maybe someone who’s helped organize
Ruby events.

If you have a minute please take a moment to nominate someone by heading
over to [RubyHeroes.com][1], typing in the github username of the person
you wish to nominate, and giving us a reason why they deserve to win.
About a month from now all the previous year’s Ruby Heroes will help
decide who will win this year’s 6 awards which will be presented to the
heroes live on stage at Railsconf at the end of April.
