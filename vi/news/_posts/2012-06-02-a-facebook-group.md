There is a new way to communicate with your fellow Ruby developers.
Introducing the new Facebook group for the [Ruby Programming
Language][1]. This group will allow for developers to communicate with
fellow Ruby programmers and provide a means for collaborative solutions
to problems members may face. It will also serve as source for news
about the Ruby project, and events–such as local workshops–related to
it. I present this group with great excitement and encourage all Ruby
developers to join and invite others. We can create a powerful
community, and the people you meet and work with here could possibly be
recruited for projects you will likely be working on in the future.
