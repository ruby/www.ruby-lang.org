There is an XML round-trip vulnerability in REXML gem bundled with Ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2021-28965](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28965). We strongly recommend upgrading the REXML gem.

## Details

When parsing and serializing a crafted XML document, REXML gem (including the one bundled with Ruby) can create a wrong XML document whose structure is different from the original one. The impact of this issue highly depends on context, but it may lead to a vulnerability in some programs that are using REXML.

Please update REXML gem to version 3.2.5 or later.

If you are using Ruby 2.6 or later:

* Please use Ruby 2.6.7, 2.7.3, or 3.0.1.
* Alternatively, you can use `gem update rexml` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "rexml", ">= 3.2.5"` to your `Gemfile`.

If you are using Ruby 2.5.8 or prior:

* Please use Ruby 2.5.9.
* <strong>You cannot use `gem update rexml` for Ruby 2.5.8 or prior.</strong>
* Note that Ruby 2.5 series is now EOL, so please consider upgrading Ruby to 2.6.7 or later as soon as possible.

## Affected versions

* Ruby 2.5.8 or prior (You can <strong>NOT</strong> use `gem update rexml` for this version.)
* Ruby 2.6.6 or prior
* Ruby 2.7.2 or prior
* Ruby 3.0.0
* REXML gem 3.2.4 or prior
