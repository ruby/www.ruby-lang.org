There is a heap exposure vulnerability in JSON bundled by Ruby.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2017-14064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14064).

## Details

The `generate` method of `JSON` module optionally accepts an instance of `JSON::Ext::Generator::State` class.
If a malicious instance is passed, the result may include contents of heap.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

## Affected Versions

* Ruby 2.2 series: 2.2.7 and earlier
* Ruby 2.3 series: 2.3.4 and earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: 2.4.1 and earlier
* prior to trunk revision 58323

## Workaround

The JSON library is also distributed as a gem.
If you can't upgrade Ruby itself, install JSON gem newer than version 2.0.4.
