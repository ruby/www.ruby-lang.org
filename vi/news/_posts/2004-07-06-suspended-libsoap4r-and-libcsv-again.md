Anonymous CVS repository for csv(lib/csv) and soap4r(lib/soap4r) were
once released to public at 2004-07-05 15:30:00 JST (2004-07-05 06:30:00 UTC).
But I, the maintainer of these repository, found my checking
process of CVS repository was not enough. So I suspended the
repositories again. Users who checkout these repositories from
<abbr title="2004-07-05 06:30:00 UTC">2004-07-05 15:30:00 JST</abbr>
to <abbr title="2004-07-06 07:30:00 UTC">2004-07-06 16:30:00 JST</abbr>
must check your CVS workspace. I’m sorry
for the trouble this error caused you. I’ll report again after
confirmation of these repositories. csv and soap libraries which are
bundled to ruby’s repository(/src/ruby) were confirmed that it is safe.
