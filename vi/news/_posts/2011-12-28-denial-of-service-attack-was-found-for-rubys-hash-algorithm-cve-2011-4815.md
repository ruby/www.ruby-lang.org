title: "Denial of service attack was found for Ruby's Hash algorithm (CVE-2011-4815)"
author: "Urabe Shyouhei"
lang: vi
---

#### Impact

This is something related to computational complexity. Specially crafted
series of strings that intentionally collide their hash values each
other was found. With such sequences an attacker can issue a denial of
service attack by, for instance, giving them as POST parameters of HTTP
requests for your Rails application.

#### Detailed description

The situation is similar to the one found for Perl in 2003. In 1.8
series of Ruby, we use a deterministic hash function to hash a string.
Here the \"deterministic\" means no other bits of information than the
input string itself is involved to generate a hash value. So you can
precalculate a string\'s hash value beforehand. By collecting a series
of strings that have the identical hash value, an attacker can let ruby
process collide bins of hash tables (including `Hash` class instances).
Hash tables\' amortized O(1) attribute depends on uniformity of
distribution of hash values. By giving such crafted input, an attacker
can let hash tables work much slower than expected (namely
O(n<sup>2</sup>) to construct a n-elements table this case).

#### Affected versions

* Ruby 1.8.7-p352 and all prior versions.

All Ruby 1.9 series are not affected by this kind of attack. They do not
share hash implementations with Ruby 1.8 series.

#### Solution

Our solution is to scramble the string hash function by some
PRNG-generated random bits. By doing so a string\'s hashed value is no
longer deterministic. That is, a `String#hash` result is consistent only
for current process lifetime and will generate a different number for
the next boot. To break this situation an attacker must create a set of
strings which are robust to this kind of scrambling. This is believed to
be quite difficult.

Please upgrade to [ruby 1.8.7-p357][1].

#### Notes

* Bear in mind that the solution *does* *not* *mean* our hash algorithm
  is cryptographically secure. To put it simple, we fixed the hash table
  but we didn\'t fix `String#hash` weakness. An attacker could still
  exploit it once he / she got a pair of a string and its hash value
  returned from `String#hash`. You *must* *not* disclose `String#hash`
  outputs. If you need to do such things, consider using secure hash
  algorithms instead. Some of them (such as SHA256) are provided in
  Ruby\'s standard library.

* For those who knows alternative hash algorithms inside our code base:
  we do not support them (they are disabled by default). By choosing
  them we consider you can read C, and you can understand what was wrong
  with the default one. Make sure that your choice is safe at your own
  risk.
