We webmasters decided to change the red only color scheme of this site
following a recommendation in [\[ruby-talk:59202\]][1].

You may see somewhat strange color scheme while our CSS development.
Thank you for your kind corporation.

And we also thank people who are discussing about color scheme on
ruby-talk.
