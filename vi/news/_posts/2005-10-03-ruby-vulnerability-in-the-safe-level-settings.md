The Ruby versions listed below have a vulnerability that allows an
arbitrary code to run bypassing the safe level check.


    Date published: 2005-10-02
    Versions affected:
      Stable releases(1.8.x) - Versions 1.8.2 and earlier (fixed on Version 1.8.3)
      Old releases(1.6.x) - Versions 1.6.8 and earlier
      Development versions(1.9.0) - Versions 2005-09-01 and earlier (fixed on Version 2005-09-02)

#### Solution:

Users of stable releases (1.8.x) and development versions (1.9.0) should
update Ruby to the latest versions listed above. Users of old releases
(1.6.x) should update to the stable releases (1.8.x) or download the
latest snapshot for 1.6.x from the URL below, build, and install.

#### Description:

The Object Oriented Scripting Language Ruby supports safely executing an untrusted code with two mechanisms: safe level and taint flag on objects. A vulnerability has been found that allows bypassing these mechanisms. By using the vulnerability, arbitrary code can be executed beyond the restrictions specified in each safe level. Therefore, Ruby has to be updated on all systems that use safe level to execute untrusted code.
