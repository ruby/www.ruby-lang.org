On behalf of the Ruby community, we are pleased to announce to you that
a brand-new ruby-lang.org is now live!

Ruby's official website has stalled over the years, leading to a situation
where only a subset of the available languages were actually maintained.
Still, their content may not even be relevant in the current Ruby ecosystem.
Something had to be done! A few rubyists thus gathered to build a whole new
contribution platform, switching from a private CMS to an open process.

Everyone is now able to edit the content and fix kinks in no time!
We have set up a git-based process and Jekyll now powers the website:
visit [https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/wiki][1] to learn more
about the project and how to contribute.

We hope to be hearing from you and reviewing your Pull Requests,

Hal Brodigan (postmodern),<br />
Jean-Denis Vauguet (chikamichi),<br />
Marcus Stollsteimer (stomar),<br />
James Edward Gray II (JEG2),<br />
Hiroshi Shibata (hsbt).
