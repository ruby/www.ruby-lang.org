Matz is visiting San Francisco and Silicon Valley on October 7th and
11th. He will be talking about new opportunities for Ruby such as
embedded applications, cloud computing, and super computing. Keynote
Speech is “Ruby 2.0 What we want to accomplish in the near future.” Not
only Matz but some cool startups from Fukuoka, Japan will give a demo on
some of their latest developments using Ruby. For more info, please go
to [http://investfk.com/][1].

By the way, the reason why Matz is coming with startups from Fukuoka is
Fukuoka is the only prefecture that has governmental Ruby committee in
Japan. Fukuoka is one of the most enthusiastic city in Japan in terms of
Ruby.
