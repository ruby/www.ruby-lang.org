      copy: |
        Ruby has a simple and intuitive syntax that reads like natural language.
        By eliminating complex symbols and verbose constructs, Ruby's design philosophy allows you to express what you want directly.
        With minimal boilerplate and high readability, it's friendly to beginners and maintainable for experienced developers.

          Ruby is just the most beautiful programming language I have ever seen.<br />
          And I pay a fair amount of attention to new program language that are coming up,
          new environments, new frameworks, and I've still yet to see anything that meets or beats Ruby in its pureness of its design.

        Ruby's expressive syntax allows you to write complex logic concisely.
        By leveraging powerful features like metaprogramming and blocks, you can reduce repetition and focus on solving core problems.
        With rich testing frameworks, you can maintain quality while achieving rapid development cycles.

          Ruby turns ideas into code fast.
          Its simplicity keeps me focused; its expressiveness lets me write the way I think.<br />
          It feels like the language gets out of the way, leaving just me and the problem.
          With great tools and libraries, ideas quickly become running, elegant, code.

      copy: |
        Ruby has a vast collection of libraries called gems, supporting everything from web development to data processing.
        With mature frameworks like Rails and comprehensive toolchains, you can combine excellent existing resources
        to build high-quality applications quickly without reinventing the wheel.
